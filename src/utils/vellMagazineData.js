The latter is true until the metaverse is mentioned.

Influencers such as Miquela (@lilmiquela), who has a following of three million on Instagram, and was created by LA-based tech start-up Brud and is managed by a PR firm Huxley are bringing out different forms of influencing. The virtual model is self-sufficient. Brands and marketing agencies will likely flock to create their own virtual influencers or avatars, whether on Instagram or the metaverse. This is likely due to the low-cost, high-reward results that these influencers provide. Once they’ve established a fan-base, they can sell-out products, inform and  excite, just like any real-life influencer.",

Wolves buried food that they couldn’t eat immediately in order to protect themselves and the pack against any future periods of scarcity.  This food is consequently protected from scavengers, either birds or land-based, and the wolf was able to remember the location of the cached food through associative memory and scent.",

Born in 1883 in Saumur, France, Chanel revolutionized women's fashion in the early 20th century by creating elegant and comfortable clothing.

Should we sit (very obediently of course) on the fence?The answer is, as part of the dog-loving community, we find it a mixed bowl.  There are certainly some bits that we consider treats, but other parts that for us are about as appealing as old, soggy kibble.Some will remember the controversy surrounding the German Shepherd breed standards where dogs with crooked backs, unable to stand comfortably, were entered into the show to wide public condemnation, with many animal charities voicing their concerns.To be fair to the Kennel Club, they have addressed these concerns by tightening breed standards to avoid cruelty through breeding and pronounced ” health and welfare of dogs is the primary objective of the Kennel Club”.",

      "Animal Kind – How the Pet Niche Has Become a Shining Beacon of Kindness and Charity Amongst Influencers",
    content:
      "<p class='first'>Do you ever feel cynical  about how genuine people are on social platforms such as Instagram?  Are the stories they tell through carefully planned glitzy images just a marketing strategy to gain followers and grasp lucrative sponsorship deals for every targeted post? Before you feel dog-tired of the superficial vanity-fest of social platforms, or perhaps sometimes they leave you barking mad, you might do well to look towards the pet niche for a more selfless model of influencing.  Ironically this is the paw-fect place to find not only cutest of animals, but also the best of humanity.Yes, of course, pet influencers also make money.  Some have amassed huge followings with brands queuing up to find the perfect furry ambassador for their products.But there is a high proportion of prominent influencers in this niche using their sway to do some genuine good in the world and lend a helping hand (and paw) to a range of rescue and welfare animal charities.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Who are these philanthropic furballs?</h3><p>Finding a niche where the promotion of charity is more prevalent would be a little bit like howling to the moon.  This space is just packed full of animal-based altruists!One famous barking benefactor can be found in the form of Loki (<a href='https://www.instagram.com/loki/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@loki</a>).  Ever since being pictured cuddling up in a hammock to his human companion (Kelly Lund), this Husky-Malamute-Wolf cross has bounded to an incredible 1.8M followers.  Although sponsored by a number of huge brands, all Loki merchandise revenue is donated to the charities Canine Support Teams and Eagle Trail Mountain Wolf Sanctuary.Another high profile pooch with a charitable disposition can be found in the adorably cute form of Doug the Pug (<a href='https://www.instagram.com/itsdougthepug/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@itsdougthepug</a>) with around 3.7M followers.  Although clearly smaller in size than Loki, this Pug and his human clearly have equally large hearts and have founded the Doug the Pug Foundation for children and families whose lives have been blighted by cancer.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>So what makes the pet niche different?</h3><p>If you think about it, the pet niche centres entirely on a closely bonded relationship. For these animal-loving influencers, pets are for life. Their followers watch them live, love and cry in an emotive relationship with their beloved pets.But many other popular niches, such as fashion and crafts ultimately deal in disposable objects. While others that deal in lifestyle choices, such as Travel and Beauty have their merits, but are generally focused only on our own well-being.Psychologists have long argued that pets provide us with a sense of selflessness and well-being in taking up responsibility for the nurture and care of a dependent sentient creature.  In short, they suggest pet-oriented people tend to be “more communal/agreeable and open tend to be more compassionate toward animals.” [1] So the idea of charity and kindness is already baked into the nature of the pet niche.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Pet Influencer Rescues</h3><p>This is perhaps reflected in the fact that many of these famous pets were rescued by their owners.  Even in other relationship-based niches, such as Family and Childcare, the concept of adoption or ‘rescue’ is far less endemic.This naturally leads famous furries to be ambassadors for other unwanted or surrendered animals in a similar plight, as well as inspiring others to rescue dogs through their heart-warming and powerful stories.One famous example of this is Simon, (<a href='https://www.instagram.com/simonsits/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@simonsits</a>), a foxy looking mixed breed who was rescued from Korea.  This lovable pet boasts 4M followers on Instagram, and constantly promotes dog rescue charities, as well as offering advice on how to provide the support needed for anyone rehoming a neglected and anxious dog.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Beauty is only fur deep</h3><p>With so many influencers rescuing unwanted animals, rather than pristine pedigrees, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the pet niche is at the forefront of challenging traditional aesthetic standards on Instagram and other social media platforms. In fact, ‘difference’ is actively celebrated and adoption of pets who don’t fit the standard ‘mould’ actively encouraged.Josh the Doodle, (<a href='https://www.instagram.com/joshthedoodle/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@joshthedoodle</a>), offers just one moving and inspirational example.  This beautiful soul has a severe neurological disorder and constantly promotes awareness of dogs with similar conditions.  His owner, Kimberley, powerfully explains exactly what this relationship means to her: “Josh is one of a kind. I no longer feel compelled to explain all the nuances of loving him, his journey speaks for itself. His smile cancels the critics, his exuberance silences every naysayer and his joy is healing.”This delightful Doodle is joined on Instagram by a lovable cast of other pets who could easily be passed over based on looks alone. Among them sits a cat named Lil BUB (<a href='https://www.instagram.com/iamlilbub/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@lilbubb</a>), who may not have any teeth, but this marvelous moggy has gained around 2.4M followers and constantly uses her influence to champion and promote other pets desperately in need of a home.Another leading light is Lumen, the Great Dane, was dumped in a box on a roadside, probably due to her suffering deafness alongside deformed feet.  But Lumen with the help of her human, Ashley, has now founded a charitable foundation.  In the words of Ashley:   “We are all worth love. Sometimes we just need someone to take a chance on us.”</h3><h3 class='sub-head'>Be like the Pet Niche</h3><p>So the pet niche offers far more than an opportunity to smile and coo at the adorable antics of our small, cute furry friends; although I won’t be giving this up any time soon!Many influencers in this niche show us not only the potential of social media platforms to support charity, but the generosity of the human spirit at its finest.  In short, this trend provides a vision of what influence should be, and the hope that more of Instagram and social media can be more like the haven of kindness and charity that is the pet niche</p>",

But what is immediately noticeable is that the top dogs on Instagram are not necessarily the most popular breeds in the real world.</p><p>Here is the list with real-world popularity rankings in brackets as based on the American Kennel Club’s registration data of 2021.</p><ol><h3 class='sub-head'>Top 10 most popular dog breeds on Instagram</h3><li>Chihuahua (AKC (37))</li><li>Pug (AKC (33))</li><li>French Bulldog (AKC (2))</li><li>Bulldog (AKC (6))</li><li>Golden Retriever (AKC (3))</li><li>Labrador Retriever (AKC (1))</li><li>Siberian Husky (AKC (19))</li><li>Dachshund (AKC (10))</li><li>Poodle (AKC (5))</li><li>Pomeranian (AKC (24))</li></ol><h3 class='sub-head'>Dog Breeds of Instagram - Dog Stars or Left in the Doghouse.</h3><p>I mean I’m a huge Rottweiler fan.  These big, handsome hounds, originally bred by the Romans to guard camps and herds of cattle, sometimes unfairly get a bad rap, but they are, in fact, highly intelligent, trainable with balanced temperaments.  They are rightly placed at number 8 in the AKC popularity rankings but are nowhere to be seen in these rankings</p><p>Even the Labrador Retriever, which has topped the AKC real-life breed rankings since 1991, may lose some of the spring in its tail finding itself trailing suddenly at number 6.</p><p>A close look at these differences might cause us doggy types to paws for thought.  Not only to consider the specific profile of dog lovers on Instagram, but why certain breeds shine on Instagram, while others more popular in real life seem to find themselves left out in the doghouse when it comes to social media platforms.</p><p>Looking at this more deeply may even give us more insight into the dynamics and culture of Instagram.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Small is Big</h3><p>It is immediately noticeable that the smallest dog on the planet, actually has the biggest presence on Instagram.  There are over 23 million posts with the Chihuahua hashtag.  This little Mexican breed seems to have charmed Instagram not only with its cheeky feistiness but also its incredible cuteness and the disposition of owners to dress their dogs up in various outfits.</p><p>Just a short, cute nose behind comes the Pug, the French Bulldog and the English Bulldog.  These diminutive dogs are known to attract the same profile of owners as the Chihuahua.</p><p>These dogs are not particularly athletic and generally like to be at home.  They all have protruding eyes lending them endearing and photogenic looks.  Due to their smaller size they also tend to be pampered and like the Chihuahua are often spotted on Instagram bedecked in costumes as elves at Christmas, eggs at Easter and possibly pumpkins during Halloween.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>A healthy perspective?</h3><p>But these dogs are not everybody’s cup of tea.  Indeed, the Pug, and both English and French Bulldogs are known to amongst the least healthy breeds due to having been bred with shorter snouts, so that they are flat-faced (the technical term for this is Brachycephalic).   This can lead to breathing problems, eye skin infections and even problems with their teeth.</p><p>Also, their protruding eyes may play nicely to the camera, but in reality, they are also more prone to infections and other complications.</p><p>It is possible to form the conclusion that even within the sphere of dog breeds aesthetic appearance takes precedence over health and well-being.</p><p>Indeed, many canine lovers away from the rarefied world of social media, feel that dogs are happiest when fulfilling natural instincts through walking, exploring and play rather than propped up a sofa wearing sunglasses and an ‘outfit’</p><p>This is not to say that pet influencers who put their dogs in these cute poses are not caring for their dogs.   But it is still arguable that the image projected is not a good or positive one, in terms of emphasising a dogs’ happiness and well-being. </p><p>There is no evidence that any dog ‘enjoys’ being dressed up, so this is done purely as click-bait for human followers to not only coo over, but also possibly to mimic with their own dogs.</p><p>Perhaps Rottweilers are not quite so popular because I certainly wouldn’t want to be the one attempting to squeeze them into a Christmas pudding outfit.  Browsing through the more popular Rottweiler influences, such as <a href='https://www.instagram.com/missdanimathers/?hl=en'>@missdanimathers</a> and <a href='https://www.instagram.com/rottie_girl/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@rottie_girl</a> their dogs are presented living their lives naturally as dogs.</p><p>It might be that those who own these smaller, less active breeds are naturally more sedentary and choose these breeds as they themselves are not as active.  This possibly indicates a greater proportion of leisure time spent at home amongst its owners who are possibly more disposed to look at dog pictures on social media, rather than be out with their dogs in natural settings and situations.</p><p>But that is not to say that there are plenty of more positive role-models out there amongst the pet influencing community.  Take, for example, Josh the Doodle (<a href='https://www.instagram.com/joshthedoodle/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@joshthedoodle</a>), a flag-bearer and champion of dogs who suffer from disabilities.</p><p>In our view we would wish that Josh the Doodle and the many other influencers who promote dog charities and well-being and offer rich, meaningful stories should always be the top dogs in influence culture rather than the cute, cuddly canines that currently lead the Instagram pack.</p>",

  //     "<p class='first'>As the festive period returns to decorate yet another year, so does the rhetoric of austerity. In the <a href='https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-autumn-statement-2022-speech' target='_blank'>Autumn Statement</a>, Jeremy Hunt speaks of “difficult decisions” and global “headwinds”, citing British “resilience” to “challenges” faced in the past. As people in the UK tighten their belts and brace for a leaner and colder Christmas, I propose a reconsideration of this holiday and its seemingly inseparable ties to consumerism.</p><img src='/images/graditute-1.jpg' alt='graditute' class='graditute'><p>The image above presents an eerily dystopian view of the high street during the festive period. During this time, retailers take an estimated 20-40% of their annual turnover. However, whilst this economically benefits companies, it can be individually devastating. According to the Bank of England, people spend around £740 more in December - 29% higher than the average month. The invasiveness of social media and marketing - depicting idealised versions of the perfect Christmas - through multiple channels such as Instagram and Tiktok mean it is harder than ever to escape this pressure. This can lead to feelings of guilt, shame and sadness which take a toll on our mental health, making us more likely to risk going into debt to meet expectations</p><p>Where people’s income could be better directed to other areas, there is a push for disposable goods which contributes to a greater pollution and sustainability problem. UK waste - such as excess food, wrapping paper and packaging - rises 30% during the Christmas period in comparison to the rest of the year. Although companies are responsible for a vast amount of pollution, it is worth being conscious about our own unsustainable habits which may be further harming the environment.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>The Power of Gratitude</h3><p>In the wake of increasing economic challenges, this Christmas may be an appropriate time to open up discussions regarding gratitude and giving in a non superficial sense. A study conducted by UC Berkeley analysed 300 individuals; mostly adults at college seeking mental health counselling. The study involved splitting participants into three groups. One group wrote a letter of gratitude to another person each week for three weeks. The second group wrote about their inner negative thoughts and feelings. The third group did not complete a writing activity. The study found an increase in reported mental health both four and twelve weeks after completing the gratitude letter writing task.</p><p>This study is one of many which have discovered the positive impact of practising gratitude, either by displaying it to those around us or keeping private gratitude journals. Whilst sharing gratitude can serve to have an even greater impact, acknowledging our blessings personally can have just as beneficial effects. Furthermore, gratitude is long lasting, as follow up studies found that people who reported higher levels of gratitude were more likely to give money to causes in a ‘pay it forward task’ reflecting the true season of giving.</p><p>This year, perhaps consider the power of gratitude as a means to give back to your loved ones. It is bound to make them light up in a gloomier festive season. Whilst having nice things is nice, it is worth remembering: nothing material will complete you, this Christmas, or ever.<p></p>With that being said, I wish you a very Merry Christmas.</p>",

      "<p class='first'>If art mirrors life, then the same thing might be said for advertising.  A huge number of businesses are falling over themselves to put a bark in their brand, or a meow in their marketing.</p><p>This happens at a time when pet ownership, in part due to lockdown, has undergone a huge upsurge.    It is now estimated, for example, that around 59% of households in the United Kingdom now own a dog (that’s around a population of 12.5 million dogs) [1].<p/><p>At the same time there is a stampede of brands rushing towards harnessing paw power to promote their services and products.  Perhaps this is no surprise when these cute furries can command gargantuan followings on social media platforms.  A pint-sized Pomeranian called Jiff offers an extreme example of this having amassed an incredible 9.6 Million followers on Instagram and 20.6 million on Tik Tok.</p><p>But how exactly did this happen?  There are many reasons for us welcoming pets into our homes, but how did they bound so strikingly into the digital market space?</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Animals in Traditional Advertising</h3><p>It is not hard to track down very successful advertising campaigns in more traditional media like television.</p><p>You only need to think of the Andrex puppy, a little Labrador  who has charmingly and mischievously been chasing toilet rolls since the 1970s.  Another iconic dog may be found in the Dulux dog, an Old English Sheepdog.  This canine has been adding a splash of colour to this brand’s advertising for over 60 years fully showing the power of pooches in advertising.</p><p>An excellent example of a successful one-off campaign can be found in Budweiser’s 2014 Super Bowl advert  ‘Puppy Love’, which tells the story of an unbreakable friendship between a puppy and a horse.  Due to its tear-jerking appeal it was named as the most popular Super Bowl commercial ever in 2016.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Why are animal adverts so successful?</h3><p>The premise of all advertising and marketing is to make prospective customers feel some kind of positive association with a brand or product.  But this is already done-for-you when you place an animal on your screen.</p><p>Not only are the movements and antics of animals visually eye-catching, but to humans, particularly pet owners, these four-legged friends suggest a sense of well-being and fun.  Many studies have shown how positive an impact a pet can have on our lives, and even both our physical and mental health.We also associate pets with strong and positive relationships where we may find comfort and hope even in the darkest times.</p><p>This connection with our pets is strengthened even further by something called anthropomorphism in advertising.  This is where pets are given human thoughts and feelings.  For example, the Dulux dog proudly bearing a brush in its mouth or a horse leaping over fences to stop his little puppy buddy being taken away from him forever.</p><p>Humans want to feel a deep connection with animals, to recognise that we are not separate from nature and the world around us.  This kind of advertising subconsciously fulfills this need as well as making us feel closer to our beloved pets</p><h3 class='sub-head'>The Rise of the Pet Influencer</h3><p>But with the arrival of social media platforms the use of animals in marketing has risen exponentially.The reasons for this revolve once again around the idea of relationships. Although we have pinpointed some of the reasons for successful advertising using animals, Pet Influencers take these ideas a step further.</p><p>The animals used in traditional advertising are endearing and lovable, but at the same time they are generic: they don’t have names and their story ends when the advert ends.But the Pet Influencer offers a continuing story of their lives with their animal companions over months and years. This allows their followers to develop a strong relationship with both the pet and the owner.</p><p>Also while adverts often offer glossy backdrops and dramatic moments, a Pet Influencer can also offer the everyday nature of the trials and tribulations of pet ownership. Like everyone else they might have to take their sickly pet to the vets, pick up poo or clean up their mud-soiled carpets.  This means that their audience of pet-loving followers can identify much more strongly with an influencer, and build a relationship based on trust and shared experience. All the psychological advantages of using animals in advertising are therefore intensified many times over if marketers use influencers to promote their bands.</p><p>Add to this the fact that animal based material not only have very high engagement rates but number consistently among the top 10 most shared items across the internet.  This means that influencer-based marketing can be expected to extend its reach beyond the direct followers of any particular influencer offering a huge return on investment for brands.  This also opens the door to leveraging Micro Influencers who may only have a few thousand followers, but any number of these followers may share a post to other pet-loving friends and followers.</p><p>Love of animals, and particularly our pets, is a common denominator amongst huge swathes of the online community engaging directly with our emotions and subconscious.   So for anyone looking for an effective marketing strategy with high returns they could do far worse than looking to Pet Influencers for a helping paw.</p>",

      "Success Stories – How the Art of Storytelling Has Made Models and Influencers the Hottest Property in Digital Marketing",

      "<p class='first'>It is, without doubt, story time in the world of digital marketing. Telling stories is probably the oldest art form in the world.  But it is also widely acknowledged as the most effective strategy in the modern world of digital marketing.</p><p>In any advertising campaign or product launch, stories are now deployed by the more skillful marketeers to hook in potential customers and coax them up the sales funnel.</p><p>But the most powerful and popular stories are those provided by Influencers on social media platforms.</p><p>This means in the last couple of years brands are falling over themselves to harness the power of these stories to market their products and services.</p><p>But what does this mean for the micro-influencers? By getting into bed with these brands are they discovering a gold-mine or is there a danger of digging themselves into a hole where they could damage their relationship with their followers?  Can the opposing forces of relationship-based influence and commercialism be bound together</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Why is story so powerful in marketing?</h3><p>Ever since humans sat around in caves with their intent faces lit by flickering firelight, we have always loved a good story.  But the very same reasons that made storytelling sopowerful, remains true to this day.</p><p>Once a story is started, the natural curiosity of the human brain demands to know how it ends.  We just can’t stop ourselves from reading.  So if Michael has always suffered from back pain until he found this incredible product, then our eyes will continue to scan down that email until we find out the details of this ‘miraculous cure’.</p><p>Or if we are introduced to Jennifer, a model who was finding it difficult to find regular work until she finds this incredible agency, we cannot rest until we hear about how this wonderful turnaround in her fortunes occurred.</p><p>But how does this magic work?</p><p>Well, rather than being presented with transparent marketing slogans almost demanding that we part with our well-earned cash, it suddenly feels like we are listening to Michael or Jennifer rather than the marketing outreach of the brand who is sending the email.  We identify and sympathise with the pain-points of these individuals and find ourselves desiring the same happy ending for ourselves.</p><p>At the same time such a story acts like a testimonial on steroids.  They appear to  give instant social ‘proof’ to the brand or company from two people whose lives have been changed forever by a product or service. </p><h3 class='sub-head'>Influencers - the power of stories with realism</h3><p>But there are a couple of problems with the stories that are told by these marketeers on behalf of the brands.  You will never meet Michael or Jennifer as they may not actually exist.  The characters of these stories cannot be proven to be real and authentic: there is every possibility that they are fictional characters constructed only to win our confidence.</p><p>Just as switched-on millennials are widely reported as guarded and suspicious when confronted with traditional advertising methods, so they are beginning to smell the artificiality of these stories.</p><p>Market-leading brands have become increasingly aware of this in the last couple of years.  One commentator, Neal Schaffer, in his ‘Age of Influence’ highlights case studies which show that the return on investment (ROI) to be “as high as eleven times the return on traditional digital marketing options such as banner adds”.</p><p>The reason being that micro-influencers offer real stories with which their audience can fully identify.  The characters or should we say influencers are very real and they are also telling their own story. This is powerful and brings us a lot closer to them than a character in an email, whose narrative is told in well-crafted language structured to pull us directly into some form of purchase.</p><p>This means that between an influencer and their followers a bond or relationship is first formed and then deepens, and such a relationship is the foundation of successful marketing.  Michael the Micro-Influencer in the family niche does not simply appear in an email campaign, but rather changes nappies, agonises over the right school for his child and struggles with bringing up his teenager.  In the same way, Jennifer in the pet niche, still picks up her dog poo, anxiously takes her beloved pooch to the vets and clears up the coffee stains as her mug is swept from the table by a frantically wagging tail.</p><p>Because these are real people in real situations, we empathetically live out their highs and lows with them on a monthly or even yearly basis.  But the characters featured in a story during an email campaign can only be, at best, one-hit wonders, who disappear from our lives as soon as we hit the ‘x’ and close the email.</p><p>This authentic relationship that micro-influencers have with their followers breeds trust.  They do not even seem to sell the brands they promote; it feels more like a friend gently advising us to give something a whirl.  Ironically it takes us back to a pre-digital age of ‘word-of-mouth’ selling a world away from the fast-paced, quick-selling and often deceitful world of digital marketing. And the millennials seem to love it.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>How can influencers ensure a happy ending when promoting a brand?</h3><p>The appeal of unparalleled ROIs means that marketeers are now spending quite a bit of time wooing micro-influencers to promote their brand.</p><p>While it may be flattering and potentially lucrative, it is important to ensure that you do not simply become a vehicle for any brand or product willing to open their very large wallets.</p><p>Remember, that as a micro-influencer you are building your own ‘brand’ founded on trusting a relationship.  If your stories start to become a fig-leaf covering a sales pitch for a product or a service, your followers will sense this and begin to lose trust.</p><p>Most importantly, don’t let any brand change you.  The posts that you release should always be your story. The reason that a brand has approached you will be because you have a high engagement and share rate with your followers, so don’t change that successful formula.</p><p>The brands should understand and respect this and if they don’t naturally fit into the stories that your followers enjoy, then consider writing them out of your script.</p><p>For a bucket-list of tips on how to promote products in relationships with brands that allow you to grow, but at the same time land lucrative sponsorship deals, feel free to check out this article on ‘How to Find the Brand of your Dreams’.</p>",

      "<p class='first'>This issue of VMagaziine we are listening out very excitedly for the sound of hooves clattering on the roof as we turn our spotlight on the animals which every child associates with Christmas.</p><p>Even when not hitched to Santa’s sleigh, we will discover that in many ways reindeers are still quite magical animals.  We will also look at how they have always flown high, not only in the sky on Christmas Eve, but in the imaginations and mythologies of cultures for millennia.</p><p>This fascinating animal is not only be found in mythology, but a certain very special reindeer also represents surely one of the biggest coups in branding and influencing in history.</p><p>So we suggest that you sit comfortably, possibly before a roaring fire while the snowflakes dance outside your window, while we tell the story of the iconic reindeer.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Some Interesting Facts about Reindeers:</h3><p>Reindeers have 4 stomachs:  all the better for eating all those carrots, and perhaps even sneaking away the odd mince pie on Christmas Eve.</p><p>They can run up to speeds of 50mph although this does increase significantly when powered by the sparkling magic of Christmas.</p><p>Wild reindeers like to travel, and can range as far as 1,600 miles in a single year</p><p>Their fur traps air making them buoyant in water, a fantastic attribute so water does not get in their way.</p><p>Their hooves are hard to gain traction in ice and snow, but naturally soften and adapt when they encounter wet ground in order to gain a better grip</p><h3 class='sub-head'>History of Reindeers</h3><p>The fact that these wonderful creatures have two names gives a clear indication of how their importance spans different cultures across the northern hemisphere.</p><p>The word ‘Reindeer’ comes from Old Norse ‘hreinin’ and refers to their magnificent antlers in directly translating as ‘horned animal.  This term is now more generally applied to animals which are more domesticated and live in farms.</p><p>But their other name, Caribou, is actually Canadian French and means ‘scratcher’ or ‘digger’.  This refers to how this very resourceful animal is capable of foraging for food when travelling through the ice-bound regions of the world.</p><p>This animal has proved a hardy survivor over many thousands of years.   Fossil evidence points to them evolving over 5 million years ago and making their way into the landmass now known as Northern America around 250, 000 years ago.</p><p>Although not indigenous in the UK anymore, archaeological evidence has shown that they became widespread in Britain around 750,00 years ago.  Sadly, these early reindeer were hunted into extinction from our shores around 8000 years ago, but have continued to flourish in the Arctic tundra, Scandinavia, Russia, Greenland, Canada and Alaska.</p><p>The reindeer is a great survivor, and it is these qualities that have earned it such admiration amongst the humans who lived alongside them, and enshrined them in the imaginations and mythologies of cultures.</p><p>According to pagan tradition, it was a female reindeer who pulled the chariot of the sun goddess across the sky many thousands of years before male deer did the same task for Santa Claus.  What makes this an even greater triumph is that this solitary female reindeer did this daily, whereas the more famous team of six males were only called upon once a year.</p><p>The reindeer had already become associated with strength, resilience, reliability and as very wise travellers, known to emigrate successfully over many hundreds of miles.</p><p>So, it was no surprise that with the advent of Christianity and then Father Christmas in the 19th century, the reindeer would become the animal of choice to navigate across every roof and chimney in the world on that one special night.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>The Reindeer and Christmas</h3><img src='/images/reindeer-1.jpg' class=reindeer /><p>Although a reindeer with her antlers aglow pulled the sun across the sky, Nordic and Germanic legends had Odin, the father-god, ride a pretty nifty eight-legged horse called Sleipner on the eve of Winter Solstice, the celebration which later became Christmas.</p><p>On this night, children would leave food and treats that no eight-legged horse could possibly resist, such as carrots and hay, and in return father Odin would deposit gifts in each household.</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>But with the arrival of Father Christmas, Sleipner went into a well-earned retirement, hopefully with a never-ending supply of hay and carrots, and his now resting eight legs were replaced by eight reindeer: Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner and Blitzen.</p><p>These very famous reindeer, but not the most famous reindeer of course – we’ll have to wait just a bit longer for his appearance, were introduced to the world on 23rd December 1823, in the poem ‘A Visit from St Nicholas’ (also known as ‘The Night Before Christmas’) appeared in the New York Sentinel:</p><p>'Now, DASHER! now, DANCER! now, PRANCER and VIXEN!</p><p>On, COMET! on CUPID! on, DONNER and BLITZEN!</p><p>To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!</p><p>Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!'</p><p>This incredible team of reindeers are then compared to ‘dry leaves’ in a ‘hurricane’ as they mount into the sky and dash away at speeds which can now only be understood through the advance technology of Nasa’s Santa Tracker, for those who follow it on Christmas Eve – ahem.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Enter Rudoph and a branding triumph</h3><p>So recruiting Santa Clause as your brand ambassador is pretty impressive.  Nobody could really deny that.  So full kudos to Coca Cola who in 1931 had a cartoonist called Haddon Sundblom draw Santa Claus for Christmas adverts, notably replacing his green outfit (symbolising growth and spring) with their very own quite garish red.</p><p>But Montgomery Ward, the owner of a Chicago department store, whose business still flourishes today as a mail-order company, arguably pulled off an equally impressive marketing coup commissioning a writer and illustrator, Robert L May, to create both a story book and a colouring book featuring their own brand ambassador.</p><p>And so, Reginald the Red-Nosed reindeer was born……</p><p>No, that is not a typo.  It was later decided that Rudolph was in fact a much catchier name, and in 1939 a book entitled ‘Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer’ appeared and flew off shelves like…a flying reindeer.</p><p>Ironically the little deer with ‘his nose so bright’ offers a luminous echo of the original mother reindeer of the pagan world whose antlers shone in the sun.</p><p>Rudolph may not have been the biggest or strongest reindeer, but he sprang into our hearts as a symbol not only of spiritedness but also as a celebration of difference, and how being different can prove to be our best quality.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Reindeers are not just for Christmas – Reindeer in-flew-encers</h3><p>Just like any pet or animal, they are not just for Christmas, but also live and are cared for throughout the year.</p><p>If you are interested in experiencing the magic of reindeer throughout the whole year, and finding out how they are cared for then you can follow these reindeers in-flew-encers on social media (without trekking for 1,600 miles).</p><h4 class='h4-head'>Tromso Artic Reindeer</h4><p>If you want magnificent pictures of reindeer with towering, branching antlers set against the snowy vistas of the Artic, then fly over to this account.</p><p>Here we have a traditional Sami family who not only care for reindeer, but celebrate them as complex, multi-faceted creatures.</p><p>This account become our guides as we watch with admiration as the reindeer live and migrate around this peninsula showing all over again their incredible ability to survive and flourish in the harshest of environments.</p><p>In pagan mythology the reindeer were seen as reliable and wise animals.  This account continues this tradition, often accompanying their images with pithy words of wisdom.</p><p>Also, they invite you to come and spend time with these animals and find some peace in the encounter with these calm, stoic creatures.</p><h4 class='h4-head'>Tatuka Reindeer Farm</h4><p>If father Christmas is too busy preparing presents and marshalling his elves, then there is an address in Lapland that offers reindeer fun the whole year round.</p><p>So, if you want to see some very happy reindeer amidst glorious forests and auburn sunsets living harmoniously alongside people, then take a look at some of the heart-warming videos amidst the chilly landscapes of this beautiful country.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Sleigh Ride Together</h3><p>So, whether you are discovering reindeer by riding on a sleigh or searching through social media, I think we can all agree that Christmas would not be the same without the reindeer.</p><p>Although they only fly through the sky once a year, they have flown through our hearts and imaginations for thousands of years, and just like Santa’s sleigh on a the busiest of Christmas Eve, this shows no sign of stopping.</p>",

      "<p class='first'>For many of us Christmas may truly be ‘the most wonderful time of the year’, full of parties, family gatherings and possibly even some wassailing (which incidentally is the Anglo-Saxon word for having a party).  Even more than this, it has become a magical time when children wait up excitedly to hear the clattering of hooves on the roof before discovering a pile of colourful the faces of children are ‘aglow’ before discovering a mound of glistening presents piled beneath a glittering Christmas tree.</p><p>This issue of VMagaziine we are listening out very excitedly for the sound of hooves clattering on the roof as we turn our spotlight on the animals which every child associates with Christmas.</p><p>But if we just remove the glitzy wrapping from Christmas, what we find underneath the veneer of our festive traditions are origins that are very non-Christian emerging from the mists of ancient pagan rituals and celebrations.</p><p>Not only this, but Christmas also has a surprising amount in common with winter festivals celebrated by other cultures and religions around the globe.</p><p>So, in this article we are going to delve into the idea that Christmas doesn’t only represent bring together family and friends around a fireside but is also connects and reflects cultural traditions and values that extend far beyond Christianity.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Paganism and Christmas</h3><p>We’ve all done it.  Cutting and pasting is a huge time-saver in our everyday working lives.</p><p>But this is also what the early Christian church did with a range of pagan festivals.  The most prominent example of this is represented by how Winter Solstice became Christmas.</p><p>The Winter Solstice celebrates the passing of the longest night of the year, as the sun is again ‘reborn’ and day once again becomes longer and gains ascendancy over the night.</p><p>The symbolism of this in terms of the return of life, growth and hope has been celebrated for time immemorial in cultures across the globe, and it is no surprise that the church wanted to channel this worshipful optimism towards the birth of the infant Jesus.</p><p>Indeed, the old Norse celebration of Yule, which was essentially a huge non-stop Viking rave for 12 days, is still used as another word for Christmas, and even to this day people gather at ancient sites such as Stonehenge to celebrate the Solstice.</p><p>Also, from Norse and Germanic traditions in this month’s VPets spotlight we focused on how Father Christmas and his magical team of 8 reindeer a reimagining of Father Odin and his magical eight-legged horse who bestrode the Nordic skies delivering presents to eager children</p><p>Finally, the idea of a celebratory feast at this time anticipating the harvests and good times returning is certainly nothing new.  Even the glittering Christmas tree hails from the German pagan traditions where celebrants gather around trees at this time of year.  It is perhaps no accident, therefore, that it was the German Prince Albert, husband-consort of Queen Victoria, who introduced the first Christmas tree to the United Kingdom in 1848.</p><p>With all this in mind, VMagaziine decided to celebrate how Christmas shows how much religions and cultures have in common in a world which too often exaggerates differences.</p><p>So here is a round-up of how some other religions celebrate the return of the light around this time of year.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Buddhists</h3><p>Buddhism has the reputation for being a very welcoming and tolerant religion which is very accepting of all traditions and beliefs.</p><p>For them, December is also a very important month in the calendar as this is when ‘Bodhi Day’ takes place which marks Buddha’s reaching nirvana through a journey of enlightenment.  The symbolism of ‘light’ representing understanding is common amongst philosophy and religion so it is fitting that this festival takes place as the nights once again become shorter.</p><p>Indeed, Buddhists celebrate for the whole of this month and even decorate a Bodhi tree with lights and decorations.  Buddhists also like to exchange gifts at this time of year.</p><p>So, this celebration begins to look a lot like Christmas, even though it distinctly belongs to Buddhism, and there is no restriction on Buddhists joining in the fun with those who are celebrating Christmas.</p><p>But Buddhism is a very embracing religion and they do accept Jesus as an important guide and teacher who puts the welfare and enlightenment of others above any selfish interests.</p><p>While Buddhists accept that Jesus was a great teacher, they do not see him as a son of god, although his teachings complement those of Buddha.  Buddhists are very keen to distribute presents and gifts at this time of year.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Hindus – The Big Day and a Festival of Lights</h3><p>Those who belong to Hinduism are another group happy to join in with the revelry at this time of year.</p><p>They also have an important religious festival at this time of year called the Pancha Ganapti which includes feasts, family gatherings and presents.</p><p>In keeping with the symbolism of renewal this five-day holiday devoted to Lord Ganesha.  In fact, the relatively new festival is another example of copy and paste but this time in reverse.  It is Christmas which is being ‘copied’ but pasted respectfully into the traditions and pantheon of Hinduism.</p><p>Just like the Christian message of redemption this festival is celebrated as an opportunity to spread forgiveness for any past wrongs.</p><p>Interestingly Hinduism is another religion which alludes to Jesus as a spiritual guide to finding a path to divinity.</p><p>Interestingly Diwali, which is the Hindu festival of lights, takes place in October.  But parallels Christmas in the celebration of light and goodness coming to banish the darkness of the world.As an interesting aside in India the big day in December is called ‘Bada Din’ or big day in Hindi which has effectively become the alternative Christmas Day falling on the 23rd of December (this originated from colonists saying that Christmas is our ‘big day’) which is an opportunity in India to enjoy a huge multicultural or pan-religious party.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Atheists</h3><p>Can atheists celebrate Christmas or should they say ‘bah humbug’?</p><p>Well, if Dickens’ ‘A Christmas Carol’ which defined and codified so much of what became the modern Christmas is anything to go by, the answer would be a definite yes.</p><p>Although this very famous novella is written very much in the Christian tradition, hence the famous words of Tiny Tim ‘God bless us everyone”, it is very much a novel about how to live a good life.</p><p>Scrooge learns that by hurting others, it is he that he hurts the most and through his enlightenment, and this book is full of images of light, that Dickens attacks the greedy capitalism that destroys the idea that humans are all in it together, or as he puts it, we are all ‘fellow passengers to the grave’.</p><p>So, for anyone that believes a renewal of self and of society is not only possible, but essential, Christmas can still offer a message of hope and unity; as well as a really good excuse to party.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Merry Christmas Everyone</h3><p>In other words, an exploration of this celebration shows just how far we are defined by our similarities rather than our differences.</p>",

      "<p class='first'>It’s a lovely picture postcard image of a puppy or a rabbit lolloping around playfully at the bottom of the Christmas tree while a joyful family gaze delightedly at this new furry addition to the family.</p><p>But so many charities and shelters are going to be asking this Christmas for anyone thinking about doing this to have a serious paws for thought as this furry fairy tale can often lead to a very unhappy ending</p><p>This image is one that many animals’ charities have tried to dispel.  One powerful example the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lRnlvS36Cc' target='_blank' class='youtube'>RSPCA Christmas advert</a> where the novelty of a puppy as present soon wears off and helpless little pooch is replaced in the box and left in a layby.</p><p>The reality of the responsibilities of owning a pet are very different.  Pets are a truly a wonderful gift, but a gift for life rather than a present for Christmas.</p><p>In this article we look at why springing a pet on somebody for Christmas is never really a good idea for so many reasons, as people must have time to prepare and think through this huge commitment.</p><p>If this does happen, we also look at where you can go for help if you are willing to keep a pet but struggling either logistically or emotionally with providing the care that your pet needs.</p><p>There were 3,004 pets recorded as abandoned and left to languish in the cold, in England and Wales last winter, to say nothing of those surrendered to a charity and 1,018 of these took place in the busiest month for shelters, December.  This needs to change.</p><p>But we do also offer some of the good news stories from social media where accounts based around a rescue animal have gained huge followings and helped to spread awareness of the joy and responsibility opting to adopt a rescue pet, rather than purchasing.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Christmas is the time for giving but avoid anything living</h3><p>The number of pets surrendered during or after the Christmas period is staggering and nothing short of tragic.  Indeed, this has led to several animals’ shelters and charities imposing a moratorium on allowing adoptions of new pets during December until after new year.</p><p>A shelter gift certificate can cover the cost of adoption – you can also sponsor dogs – this makes a great present for a dog or cat lover </p><p>Here are some of the reasons why things go so badly wrong for furries at this festive time of year:</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Noisy/Unsettled Environment</h3><p>Animals such as cats, dogs and rabbits are classed as sentient beings.  To state the obvious this means that they have thoughts and feelings and demand our respect and consideration.</p><p>But they will have no understanding of Christmas.  This can be a busy and chaotic time for all.  This means that there can be a variety of people coming and going at the home.  There may be far more noise and activity.</p><p>This can be very unsettling for any animal who needs to feel secure in a new home.  Remember these are animals who we are bringing into our very strange and incomprehensible human world.  They need quiet routine and time to bond with their human carers.</p><p>Without this, animals can become very anxious and engage in destructive behaviours within the home.  In the worst cases, dogs and cats may become aggressive (aggression is very usually a fear reaction which springs from anxiety).</p><p>Also, there are a lot of hazards around at this time, such as trailing wires and sparkly lights which look like such fun for a puppy or kitten to claw at or even bite.  Many people don’t realise how important control and management of a new pet’s environment is important to keep them safe as well as to protect valuables from inadvertent damage.This leads to ‘naughty’ animals being surrendered by those who don’t understand their needs.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>The importance of time to research and prepare for any pet</h3><p>Thinking of surprising your nearest and dearest or your children with pet.  If so, try to think again.</p><p>Animals are a lifetime commitment not a disposable gift and people need to make an informed decision to find a dog/cat/rabbit or pet that fits with their lifestyle.</p><p>A dog, cat or rabbit may mean, for example, that you need to be much more careful in planning your holiday or arrange for pet-sitters.</p><p>If this is not done properly the happiness of both the pet and the human family may be doomed from the very start.</p><p>Dogs certainly have important breed characteristics that need to be considered.  If you haven’t got much space or a garden, you would want to avoid a large dog or a working dog breed which needs time to explore outside.  Some dogs need lots of exercise, so are unsuitable for fragile or more sedentary owners.</p><p>The same might also be true of cats.  If you don’t want a cat that goes outside into the busy roads around where you live, find a breed that is happy to stay inside.  Do you want your rabbit to be free roaming?  Look into how you can make your home completely safe for them.</p><p>Even an apparently low maintenance pet such as a goldfish requires research on how to offer proper care and ensure welfare.  There is also an unfunny comic trope surrounding how people dread caring for a goldfish while the owners away in case they die.  That’s because overfeeding, for example, may well kill one of these aquatic pets.</p><p>So springing a pet on somebody might provide a lovely moment, but may well foreshadow a long period of misery for your less than thoughtful ‘gift’.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Holidays</h3><p>Owning a dog, cat, rabbit or any other pet may suddenly mean that you have to plan not only holidays but, in the case of a dog, not to be away from home for any more than around four hours.</p><p>Also, it is important to remember Christmas is classically the time when people need to be away from home – the sudden presence of a surprise present pet can be very jarring or even worse leads to this pet being neglected while these holidays take place</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Children</h3><p>The presence of children adds a new layer of complexity to getting a pet and require further consideration.</p><p>It is important to prepare children for a pet’s arrival and explain to them how a pet would be treated.  For example, if a child removes a dog’s food because he wants his new friend to ‘share’, a dog will not understand this and may develop an aggressive tendency to ‘guard’ their food.</p><p>Also, if a smaller animal is handled like a toy, this can lead to physical injury as well issues surrounding anxiety and fear.  If an animal is afraid of a child, then they will not bond with them, and the child will not understand why their ‘new best friend’ does not enjoy them coming close or touching them.</p><p>Once again research can help in respect of dogs, as some breeds are more naturally better with children and in a family context.</p><p>If this preparation is in place, looking after a pet and taken responsibility for their welfare is very developmental for children and can also offer a child emotional security.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Pets can be expensive</h3><p>Let’s be honest, for most of us there is not really a lot of cash to throw around during and after Christmas</p><p>The cost-of-living crisis as made this worse, and affordability is becoming a main reason why pets are reluctantly surrendered to shelters and charities.</p><p>Food bills are just one part of the story, but pet food, along with human food inflation, has become far more costly over this year.</p><p>The real worry for any pet owner, however, is vet bills.  Even a consultation can cost upwards of around £80.  In order to avoid very high costs, it is important to ensure your pet, but even this introduces another monthly cost.  Also, for every claim you will have to pay an ‘excess charge’ which is also likely to be at least £80.</p><p>If a pet arrives as a gift, then the receiver may not have been ready or have a budget to keep this companion over the long-term, potentially leading to a heart-wrenching decision on the part of the owner, and the suffering of an animal as it is surrendered.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Scammers and Irresponsible Breeders</h3><p>Sadly, while many of us are hard-up at Christmas, scammers and irresponsible breeders see this festive time as an opportunity to exploit both animals and buyers.</p><p>It is very important never to simply buy any pet on the internet.  Rather spend the time visiting the place or home where the prospective pet comes from.</p><p>If this pet is a gift, it is very unlikely that you will have spent time doing this.  Unfortunately, some breeders see animals as reproducing machines simply to make a quick buck.  The pictures on the internet can look very convincing.</p><p>Be careful of any immediate discounts or offers of ‘a last puppy available’.  Once again it is important to ensure that this breeder has social capital as online reviews and testimonials.</p><p>Always visit a premises and check that you see the mother and evidence of the health of both parents of your prospective pet.</p><p>If you do not do this, you may be either conned or be buying a pet with both physical and/or mental issues that will not only create upset and complications, but also potentially lead to more expense in the long run.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>The Gift of Adoption – the top of any abandoned pet’s Christmas list</h3><p>This year unfortunately we will see animal shelters bursting at the seams in desperate need of people who can foster or adopt dogs, cats, rabbits and a variety of other unwanted pet for the very reasons outlined above.</p><p>If you are serious about your family adopting and willing to put in some patience and time to give an animal the very precious gift of a loving and safe home, then you should always opt to adopt.</p><p>Be aware that rescue pets can have baggage, and some issues, but if you adopt from a respected charity then all this information will be available to help you make an informed decision.</p><p>In the case of dogs, and sometimes cats, this can take time and patience.  But these pets are very resilient and will bounce back to become treasured members of your family if you are willing to give them a chance.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Need help with vet bills?</h3><p>If you find yourself in difficult financial circumstances and need help with the veterinary costs, be aware that large charities such as the PDSA, the RSPCA and the Dogs Trust do offer help to those most in need.  This could be free help, or even ‘low cost’ help reducing fees by anything up to 30%.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Rescues of Instagram</h3><h4 class='h4-head'><a href='https://www.instagram.com/bunnymama/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@bunnymama</a>   622K Followers on Instagram</h4><figure><img src='/images/bunny-3.jpg' alt='bunny3'><figcaption>Image Source: @bunnymama on Instagram</figcaption></figure><p>Sadly rabbits may be cute and cuddly, but it is these very qualities which often lead to them ending up as gift for children.  This account burrows into the truth of that bunnies are not just for Christmas (or Easter) but demand time, commitment and understanding.</p><p>This fantastic account also gives a variety of hints and tips to care for your bunny in the best way possible.

      "<p class='first'>January is the cruellest month for many pets. Tragically, many pets giving as gifts (remember when giving should never involve anything living at Christmas), find themselves surrendered to charities, or even worse, cruelly abandoned at this time of year.</p><p>But if you are one of those kind souls, who have room both in your home and your hearts for a new member of the family, then we at Vell Magazine applaud you.</p><p>This month our spotlight falls upon animals desperately seeking the home that they deserve.</p><p>Many owners who have rescued a pet describe it in terms of a lottery win.  You might not know exactly what you are getting, but it is very likely to be a lovely and life-changing experience.</p><p>But to achieve this huge win for you and your prospective pet, it is important to research and follow guidelines.</p><p>So for all those lovely Vell Magazine readers out there looking to offer a furever home to an animal in need we have compiled some key guidelines to finding the purrfect pet for you and your family.</p><figure ><img src='/images/adopting-1.jpg'class='adopting' alt='Adopting'><figcaption>Getting a loving furry companion is like winning the lottery (Image Source: Canva)</figcaption></figure><h3 class='sub-head'>Approach a Charity</h3>There are many rescue charities out there which do incredible work not only caring for pets, but also ensuring that any rehome is successful.</p><p>Charities are required to home animals that are healthy, and this will remove any additional worries you may have regarding healthcare for your fluffy companion.  In terms of behaviour, even if there is no full history, experienced staff will have monitored the pet for some time and have insight into all the needs to be addressed.  They will also  often provide ongoing  support and help on how to go about fixing them.</p><p>Big animal charities also offer a great variety of pets which can include:</p><p>Dogs</p><p>Cats</p><p>Rabbits</p><p>Rats</p><p>Mouse</p><p>Gerbils</p><p>Degu</p><p>Chinchilla</p><p>Hamster</p><p>If possible, charities advise not to overlook older pets or ‘unfashionable’ pets such as mixed breeds dogs.  These pets will provide very loving companions and may well, in fact, be more suitable.</p><figure class=adopting><img src='/images/adopting-2.jpg' alt='Adopting'><figcaption>Rescue pets come in all shapes and sizes (Image Source: Canva)</figcaption></figure><h3 class='sub-head'>Choose a Pet that fits your lifestyle</h3><p>Even if you do approach a charity, it is highly recommended that you do your research first.  It is important to paws for thought.  Do you have an active lifestyle or are you more sedentary?  Is there a possibility that you could be away from home hours every day or can you offer human companionship to your pet most of the time?  Do you have access to a garden or an outside space or are you currently living in a flat?</p><p>This is not only important to choosing which species of pet but also which breed.  For example, if you are considering a dog, a high energy breed like a Husky or a Doberman will require hours of walking each day.  Have you got the time and energy to provide this?</p><p>If not, you might look at a breed such as a French Bulldog or Shih-Tzu that have much lighter exercise requirements.   Again, you could also consider an older dog who is happy to spend most of their time cuddled up next to you on the sofa.</p><p>If you really are the stay-at-home type then rabbits, cats and rats are interactive with people, but don’t need walking.</p><p>Also consider the geography of where you live. If you have a busy road nearby, you may want to consider a breed of cat that is happy to always stay inside.  The more factors that you consider, the better prepared you will be to care for your pet.</p><p>Remember if you do find that a specific breed would suit your lifestyle then there are also breed-specific rescue charities that may be able to help.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Be a flexible friend to your new pet</h3><p>A loving pet will give you so much, but it might mean some compromise on your part, especially during the early stages.</p><p>All pets are individuals, and a good charity will recommend any adaptations to your home or lifestyle that you may need to consider.</p><p>Also be aware that if you have any foreseeable changes in your life, such as a house move or a new job, this might not be the right time to adopt a pet.</p><p>It is important to provide a dog, cat and any other small pet with as calm and quiet an environment as possible in order to help them settle in.  Build as many positive associations as possible with this space for them, with both foods and toys.</p><figure class=adopting><img src='/images/adopting-3.jpg' alt='Adopting'><figcaption>By adopting or foster a pet you really are throwing them a lifeline (Image Source: Canva)</figcaption></figure><h3 class='sub-head'>Challenges of Rescuing a Pet</h3><p>The reason that many of these pets have been surrendered is the very fact that people have a picture postcard image of a pet without realising that they are living creatures.  When we take on a a pet we bring them into our ‘human world’ which is certainly confusing and potentially frightening.</p><p>Sadly, there are too many people not prepared to put in the preparation and/or training or ensure that they give these pets the emotional context to be successful in this world.</p><p>Also, once a pet has been surrendered, or worse abandoned, they are likely to develop emotional problems and can understandably be fearful and untrusting of humans.</p><p>Allow your pets to make the first move: picking up a dog or cat and stroking can be frightening until they can bond with you.  It will certainly be more than worth the wait!</p><p>This may be a hurdle to those who have owned pets before.  ‘My other dogs have never done that!’ or ‘my other cat was really affectionate’.  But it is important to be aware that rescue animals have often experienced trauma. </p><p>Remember that it is not the pet’s fault that they have been re-homed.  And these wonderful animals are resilient and will adapt.  It will take a little bit of time, but they will form a strong and enduring bond if offered love and patience.</p><p>A good charity will provide the support necessary to help you to be successful where the previous owners had failed.</p><p>Remember, if things get tough at times, help is always available.  Charities are also there for people thinking of giving up on their pets.  They will offer advice guidance and support, and a reminder that the pets in your care will never give up on you.  In fact, whatever the challenges, they absolutely depend on their human carers.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Money Matters – Cost of Living Crisis</h3><p>Speaking of help, many people don’t realise that it is possible to get financial help when adopting a pet.  It is also incredibly important to ensure that you have the budget to provide a high level of care to a pet.</p><p>Sadly, economic hardship has been one reason that people surrender their pets, as well as making it more difficult for charities to raise the funds to continue to care for an increasing number of animals that need rescuing.</p><p>In the first instance, adopting a pet from a charity is much cheaper than purchasing a dog from a breeder.  At the same time, you would be contributing to dampening down the demand for specific designer animals that leads to unscrupulous breeding practices for profit.  This in turn can lead to animals with poor health or difficult temperaments.</p><p>Some of the bigger charities, such as the PDSA, the RSPCA and the Dogs Trust are also on hand to help out with veterinary bills for owners finding themselves facing financial difficulties.  This can be in the form of free help or by a reduction in fees by anything up to 30%.</p><p>It is essential that you budget to get your pet insured.  This means you will not face any very nasty surprises if your pet falls ill, but you will still need to pay an excess charge.</p><p>Part of your research into the right pet for yourself should also factor in food costs.

This is hugely beneficial for anyone that struggles with mental health issues.</p><p>Not only this, but pet owners have been shown to have a quicker recovery from serious illnesses due to unconditional love and companionship offered by their beloved furry friend.</p><p>Aside from other mental health benefits there is also an added sense of wellbeing from caring for another sentient creature who is dependent on us</p><p>Lastly, you avoid feeding the monstrous trade in animals by unscrupulous breeders who care nothing for the health, temperament and future well-being of the animals they sell.  For a horrific recent example of this, over 90 Shih-Tzu dogs were found in filthy conditions in puppy farms in Cornwall(link:<a href='https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/shih-tzu-dogs-saved-horrifying-7986031' target='_blank'>https://www.cornwalllive.com/news/cornwall-news/shih-tzu-dogs-saved-horrifying-7986031</a>) </p><p>These dogs are sadly terrified of people, but the RSPCA are bringing them around, and thankfully there are people out there with both their heart and heads in the right place to adopt them.</p><p>So, if you are looking to adopt a pet then we at Vell Magazine wish you a furry tail ending for both you and your new companion.</p>",

  //     "<p class='first'>A cold drizzle settles into the seams of your clothing as you board the train for your morning commute. Your bank balance stares back at you, sad and depleted, waiting inanticipation for this month’s paycheck. The resolutions you had set with enthusiasm earlier in the month are rapidly dwindling into oblivion. Not too long until Spring, you muse, with an impatient desperation. It’s the third Monday in January.</p><p>These are the conditions for the phenomenon of ‘Blue Monday’ - at least according to a PR Stunt executed by Sky Travel in 2005. Whether or not this ‘equation’ is in fact pseudoscience, it poses the potential of a brilliant travel marketing strategy by encouraging customers to book a slice of hope into the upcoming calendar year</p><p>The reasoning behind January Blues originates from a more general acknowledgement of the post festive season, as well as symptoms arising as a result of Seasonal Affective Disorder. However, countries such as Norway, Finland and Sweden experience Polar Night - the event whereby the sun is not visible for over 24 hours - yet Finland boasts the highest score for five consecutive years on the World Happiness Report. This begs the question - what are we getting wrong in the UK?</p><img src='/images/bluesHygge.jpg' alt='graditute' class='graditute'><p>Well, the missing ingredient may be Hygge. Although the exact definition of the word is difficult to pin down, it represents a larger sentiment of comfort, coziness and general wellbeing. The Danish term gained popularity back in 2017, whereby people shared pictures of hot chocolate, fuzzy socks and fireplaces - much like the picture above - captioned #hygge. At present, there are 8.7 million posts with this hashtag on Instagram.</p><p>The aesthetics and practice of the ‘Hygge lifestyle’ captured global attention and although it has become less of a buzzword today, it is perhaps more relevant than ever with 75% of workers across the world believing that remote working is the ‘new normal’.Additionally, this shift has been viewed as overwhelmingly positive, as a study conducted by Owl Labs discovered that 88% of employees reported being happie working from home. It would seem that post-pandemic, rather than running away from our familiar environments, we are longing to spend more time there. However, with this in mind, how can we maximise our space for greater productivity and wellbeing?</p><p>The magic of Hygge involves tapping into our sensory world and responding accordingly. It is prioritising a generous work-life balance which places quality time with loved ones front-and-centre; creating room for eating a hearty meal and exchanging stories across the dinner table; not being afraid to burn our candles or use our bubble bath in fear of ‘wasting’ it on a non-momentous occasion. To Hygge, the mundane and everyday is always a sacred moment, and one that if we fail to appreciate, will slip through our grasp altogether.<p></p>This month, I encourage you to delve into the enchanted world of Hygge to soothethose January blues and ensure a calmer ocean for the remainder of the winter months.</p>",

    contentHeader: 'Creating the Ultimate Capsule Wardrobe',
    content: "<p class='first'>Capsule wardrobes are one of the best solutions to the age-old problem of having an affordable yet stylish wardrobe. They also help reduce the massive amounts of clothing that get brought or produced but never worn. It’s a fantastic way to fight the rise of fast fashion, which is extremely harmful to the environment. In a nutshell, a capsule wardrobe is a small collection of clothes that can be mixed and matched to create lots of outfits. They are easy to make and can save a great deal of time and stress when you’re searching for something to wear! Here’s what to keep in mind when you’re creating your ultimate capsule wardrobe.</p><h3>The Bare Necessities</h3><p>Before you venture out on a shopping spree, it’s important to know what your wardrobe needs to contain. What sort of dress code does your job have? What clothing items are essential for your day to day life? Ensure you have a list of what you need to include in your wardrobe before you start building it, so that you have a solid foundation to base it on.</p><p>Listing basic clothing that you’ll want in the wardrobe is a great way to figure out outfit inspiration before you start shopping. Think about shoes, trousers, shirts, jackets and dresses: which of these items do you need or want to prioritise? Remember that the shoes you pick will need to go with the clothing pieces, and vice versa.</p><div><img src='/images/wardrobe-1.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'>Image Credit: https://emilylightly.com/2022/03/spring-capsule-wardrobe/</p></div><h3>Seeking Inspiration</h3><p>It’s time to open up your wardrobe, and your social media apps. Go through your clothes and decide what you want to incorporate into your new capsule style, and what doesn’t work. Remember, it will work best if your clothing pieces are able to match or be mixed together to form cohesive outfits. Choosing too many pieces that won’t match with the rest of your wardrobe will ruin your plans, so don’t go overboard on statement pieces.</p><p>At the same time, go and make a mood board! Capsule wardrobes are ever more popular and there are countless examples you can turn to in order to get a better idea of what you like, and the style you want to use. Take your time to consider different options before you settle on a style and set clothing pieces.</p><div><img src='/images/wardrobe-2.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'>Image Credit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_wardrobe</p></div><h3>Streamline before you Shop</h3><p>As I said before, go through your wardrobe first, before going out and buying new items. If you have black or neutral trousers and shirts already, it will save you time and money when shopping as you already have the basics. On a similar note, streamline what you usually wear: whatever outfits you wear most in the day to day, streamline your wardrobe to those items (of course don’t get rid of other essentials that you may not have use for as often, such as night out wear, etc.) Using this method can help you to build a capsule wardrobe on what you already own, without the hassle of shopping for a new wardrobe</p><div><img src='/images/wardrobe-3.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'>Image Credit: https://theeverygirl.com/how-to-create-a-capsule-wardrobe/</p></div><p>Capsule wardrobes are all about minimalism, easy but stylish outfits and stress free decision making. Enjoy the process and watch the clutter from your wardrobe disappear, leaving you less stressed and with more to wear!</p>",

    contentHeader: 'Blazers & Sustainability',
    content: "<p class='first'>It’s September and the first rains are here, along with the start of a new semester (that is if you are a student, of course). The one thing I noticed as soon as I came back to University this year was that oversized blazers for women are back!</p><p>During my first lectures I still styled myself in a bachelor-y manner: flared jeans, t-shirt and trainers. But, now, the mood has changed.</p><p>I don’t like to describe myself as someone who strictly follows trends – nor as a feminist - but I love how girls this first graduate year are just going all in with the smart look: (blue light) glasses, pastel shirts and autumn-coloured blazers. It was a coup de foudre. </p><p>Blazers were really popular in the 90s among youth. However, growing up in catholic schools, I was only required to wear them on important and serious occasions, such as communion and masses. Since then I remember having a rather troubled relationship with blazers, and I did not believe I could ever wear – or even like – them again. </p><p>Today, my opinion has completely shifted and I consider blazers to be a wardrobe basic, a must have, and a go-to item. It is the perfect garment to wear for university lectures, to the office, for a virtual meeting or for an in-person conference. To sum up, blazers are the ideal clothing piece for (lightly) serious events or for an everyday casual fit. </p><div class='grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-x-2 '><div class='w-[200px]  m-auto sm:w-[400px]  sm:h-[500px]'><img src='/images/blazers-1.jpg' class='object-cover h-full w-full py-2 sm:py-0' /></div><div class='w-[200px] m-auto  sm:w-[400px] sm:h-[500px]'><img src='/images/blazers-2.jpg' class=' object-cover h-full w-full py-2 sm:py-0' /></div></div><div class='sm:py-8 flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center justify-center'><img src='/images/blazers-3.jpg' class='sm:pr-5 object-cover  w-full sm:w-[300px] h-[350px] py-2 sm:py-0'/><div><p>As soon as I noticed this trend, I immediately fell in lovewith it. I knew I had to find my own way to express myselfthrough a blazer and to let my university fashion style shine.I started digging into my closet and I found a V-neck sweatervest that could have easily been styled with a white blouseshirt and Harry Styles wide-legged sailor-style trousers.</p><p>Despite the latter very appealing choice, I was determined to dig deeper to find THE blazer. And that’s when I thought of the perfect place to look for it: my mom’s wardrobe (a vintage market will do too)! An enormous amount of perfectly stored blazers popped up, each with a different colour and pattern. </p></div></div><div class='flex flex-col md:flex-row items-center'><p><div>During these first few weeks of lectures, in my Marketing course, we explored the concept of how consumers with a fixed budget have a tendency to prefer quantity over quality in terms of fashion items. </p><p>My mom’s blazer was from MaxMara, a notorious high-end brand for jackets. It was bought almost 40 years ago but it looked as if I had bought it the same day. Surely my mom had done a great job at preserving it in her wardrobe, but most of the credit goes to the high quality of the garment. </p><p>A research paper proposed by Sun et al. (2021), concerning luxury designer brands and sustainability, is based on two interesting hypotheses. The first one was that consumers prefer to buy multiple items rather than one luxurious one, given the same budget, and the second one implied consumers’ neglect of durability. In fact, when we come to think about it if we would hold back from giving in into our consumerist self, we would be able to save more and, thereby, afford fewer luxurious clothing pieces, that would last overtime (almost like an investment).</p></div><img src='/images/blazers-4.jpg' class=' object-cover sm:w-[400px] sm:pl-4 '/></div><div class='flex flex-col md:flex-row md:justify-between md:gap-6 sm:py-8'><div class='sm:pr-3 md:w-6/12'><p>The paper was written from a sustainability standpoint. Therefore, buying less but more luxurious items better preserves the environment, in terms of sustainability, as consumers' would stop supporting fast-fashion companies such as Shein. The Chinese company's buying mentality consists in purchasing numerous garments at a low price, which is detrimental to the environment and pushes consumers into buying things that - most of the time - are not truly needed.</p><img src='/images/blazers-5.jpg' class=' object-cover w-full py-2 sm:py-0'/></div><div class='sm:pl-3 md:w-6/12'><img src='/images/blazers-6.jpg' class=' object-cover  w-full py-2 sm:py-0'/><p class='sm:pt-5'>Coming back to my University days, I ended up styling my mom’s blazer - in a sportier, casual yet classy way - with a white shirt from Lacoste, a P&B wide legged light brown jeans and AirForce One white trainers. I then went to class and rocked it! </p></div></div>",

The concert took place at a private event attended by around 1,500 guests including Kendall Jenner, Nia Long, Liam Payne, Ashley Park, Jay-Z, and many influencers from the region and public figures.</p><p>According to reports, Queen Beyonce earned $24 million for her performance. As it was a private event, the performance was supposed to be kept a secret. In this digital age, one cannot pretend anything is a secret... especially when the most loved Queen Beyonce is sharing the stage with Blue Ivy.</p><p>Throughout the night, Lebanese talent was evident – and I couldn’t be prouder.

      "Micro-Influencers - 8 Tips for Finding the Brand of Your Dreams",
    content:
      "<p class='first'>For a micro-influencer trying to grow their following choosing which brands they should promote can read a little bit like dating advice.</p><p>You certainly don’t just want to take the first one that turns up.  Also  one-off advertisements deal with a brand which does not suit the personality and ethos of your instagram persona, however handsome the promised returns, could prove harmful in the long run.</p><p>An account with only a few thousand followers is still developing, and like a fledgeling bird is more vulnerable to a crash landing.  Credibility and trust are qualities that can take a long time to gain, but can be lost pretty quickly if followers sense that the main driver is to make a quick buck.</p><p>Instead it is better to seek and select brands with which you can imagine a more long-term and serious relationship where the influencer and a brand mutually build authenticity around a product or service which aligns with both ethos and interests of followers.</p><p>So here are 8 Top Tips for Finding a serious and positive relationship with a suitable brand and avoiding a short-term fling which could leave your Instagram account and revenue seriously damaged:</p><h3 class='sub-head'>1) You already know each other -  familiarity with brand and the product</h3><p>Of course you would want to get to know a potential partner well before you carried on dating, the same goes for brands and the products that they offer. </br>Ideally an influencer should find a brand that they are familiar with, or at least have first-hand experience of their products.</p><p>This should not be difficult with a good brand whose outreach should include the offer of a trial of said product or service before the launching of a proposed campaign.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>2)	You can enjoy natural, unforced conversation</h3><p>However well you write and structure your posts, if you genuinely enjoy a product or service you will come across as more natural and credible in your post. </p><p>This will also ensure that should your followers have any questions or comments, you will be in a position to engage</p><figure><img src='/images/micro-1.jpg' alt='Rottweiler'><figcaption>Your promotion of a product should be as natural and free-flowing as a relaxed conversation (Image Source:)</figcaption></figure><h3 class='sub-head'>3)	You have met through friends or an ex will vouch for them</h3><p>If the brand is new to you, have a search on Instagram for any appearances of the brands.  In the best case scenario, accounts that you follow or can relate to has advertised this brand’s products and services.  If not, you could ask the brand why about their previous advertising campaigns.  Do they have any examples of previous collaborations which might give them social proof?  Many good brands will include previous examples of successful advertising in their pitch to you.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>4)	Ensure the brand love you for yourself, and not what you can offer them</h3><p>Instagram should really be about creative freedom, and this is how many instagram accounts become successful.  Any brand that approaches you should respect your creativity in how you decide to promote a product or service.  Any brand who is too controlling may be one to avoid.</p><figure><img src='/images/micro-2.jpg' alt='Rottweiler'><figcaption>A well-matched brand will go hand-in-hand with the continued growth of your following (Image Source:)</figcaption></figure><h3 class='sub-head'>5) A suitable match</h3><p>This is something that a brand should be fully aware of before they pitch a product.  But always be very careful to ensure that the target audience of a product or service broadly matches the demographic of your audience. If not then both the brand’s ROI and your own credibility could both take a hit.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>6)	Make yourself attractive</h3><p>This suitability is really important as the advert’s success will be measured not only in how many of your followers are reached, but also the frequency of interaction with yoru post as well as shares with others beyond your own following.  Evidence of this will also make you more attractive to other brands</p><p>This is not to say that pet influencers who put their dogs in these cute poses are not caring for their dogs.   But it is still arguable that the image projected is not a good or positive one, in terms of emphasising a dogs’ happiness and well-being. </p><h3 class='sub-head'>7) A meeting of minds - Find a brand with ethics</h3><p>If you feel that you and your Instagram account have certain ethics try to find a brand that does not undermine this.  Even better, research brands that have a proven track record of ethical practices in their products and services.</p><p>This might mean charitable activities or sensibility to the environment and/or animal welfare.  A partnership will therefore not only offer a product that your followers are more likely to have an interest in, but will also continue to consolidate the influencers ‘brand.  Remember, consistency in outlook is vital in continuing to grow your followers; an account that seems to want to make a quick buck will soon prove to be a real turn-off.</p><figure><img src='/images/micro-3.jpg' alt='Rottweiler'><figcaption>A proven track record of ethics associated with a product or brand are all good signs you consider before promoting them (Image Source: canva.com)</figcaption></figure><h3 class='sub-head'>8)	Flexibility in the relationship</h3><p>Also consider the terms of your agreement with a particular brand. How are the brand proposing to pay you?  Some offer a flat rate per post, but if you are confident you can promote a product successfully then a good brand should be flexible, and you should be able to request that you are paid, for example, via commission.</p><p>This relationship should be two-sided, so if the brand is insisting on dictating the terms, this might be a real red-flag, that this is one to avoid</p><p>So the advice to influencers hoping to grow is to avoid one-night brands which offer only very short-term gains, and look for meaningful relationships.  These brands will be respectful and won’t want to change you.</p><p>There will be plenty of other brands in the sea of social marketing platforms, and with careful research and due diligence you will find the brands that will help you and your account grow.</p>",

      "<p class='first'>If a meow is music to your ears, or perhaps a bark a beautiful sound in the world then you have come to the right place.  But we are not only catering for dogs and cats; here all pets of any species are welcome!</p><p>Each week we are going to spotlight and offer big hugs to pets that have left a significant paw print on social media platforms. Here we not only showcase the characteristics and history of a breed or species but also explore their tail-waggingly popular social media presence.</p><p>Animals, and more specifically pets, are a hugely popular on social media where around 65% of pet owners post about their furry companions on average 2 times a week [1]. Animals combine comfort, companionship and entertainment and have been scientifically to improve both physical and mental health.</p><p>Recent studies have indicated that our choice of pet or even breed reflects our personality (links), and to test this theory we look at prominent influencers associated with this breed</p><p>Today is the turn of magnificent Rottweiler.  Sometimes unfairly stereotyped we go out to prove that this dog is nothing more than a lovable rogue who adores humans.</p><figure><img src='/images/rottweiler.jpg' alt='Rottweiler'><figcaption>The Rottweiler – a lovable rogue unfairly stereotyped as aggressive</figcaption></figure><h3 class='sub-head'>Character of the Rottweiler</h3><p>Can you believe that in the 1970s film ‘The Omen’, the Rottweiler played the dogs of the devil?  Here at VMagaziine we might accept that these dogs can be ‘little devils’ at times.  We most definitely agree that the Rottweiler could be described as devilishly handsome.</p><p>But apart from that these dogs have wonderful temperaments.  They are loyal, protective with a good sense of fun.  They do get on with other dogs but are often more human-oriented and are classic Velcro dogs, always liking to stick close to their owners, even in the home.</p><p>So, what about the owners?</p><p>You can therefore expect Rottweiler owners and influencers to be intelligent, adaptable with a good sense of humour.  But also, with strong and determined personalities.</p><p>And to test how true this is, we are going to take a look at some of the remarkable “Rotties” that are rocking it on social media.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>History of the Rottweiler</h3><p>The Rottweiler’s origins can be traced way back to the Roman Empire around 2000 years ago.  It is thought that these dogs were result of breeding intelligent herding dogs with powerful mastiffs to create a winning combination of brains and brawn.</p><p>Not only did the forebears of today’s Rottweilers guard and herd the livestock, but they also offered excellent protection to the Roman camps on the march.</p><p>When the Roman Empire declined these dogs continued to flourish in northern Europe and were eventually named after the German town of Rottweil. </p><p>Eventually they acquired a nickname during the 19th century of ‘The Butcher’s Dog’. This was because this powerful breed was employed pulling carts to deliver meat across villages and towns, as well as guarding the shops. Butchers were known to hang their keys around a Rottweiler’s neck while on their travels. Sounds like a pretty effective security system to me!</p><p>Since then, this dog is a stellar member of the Working Group of dogs and has excelled in the armed forces, the police and security around the world as well as being a very popular family pet.</p><figure><img src='/images/rottweiler2.jpg' alt='Rottweiler'><figcaption>This photogenic and affectionate dogs rank as the third most popular breed on TikTok</figcaption></figure><h3 class='sub-head'>Popularity of the Rottweiler breed</h3><p>The Rottweiler is ranked as the 23rd most popular breed in the United Kingdom according to 2021 Kennel Club registration data.  In America, the Rottie gets even more love and is currently ranked as 8th in the American Kennel Club’s rankings.</p><p>In terms of number of posts and shares the Rottweiler is currently ranked around the 11th most popular on Instagram.  </p><p>On Tik Tok this breed is even more of a howling success, with the Rottie rocketing to the third most popular breed, with #Rottweiler gaining 8 billion views in 2021.</p><p>In other words, the ‘Butcher’s Dog’ is making mincemeat out of the most of the other dog breeds when it comes to online popularity.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Some Rottweiler accounts we rave about</h3><h4 class='h4-head'>Lola (<a href='https://www.instagram.com/ourgirllola_/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@ourgirllola_</a>) – 9,300 followers</h4><p>If anybody needed any more proof that the only thing really frightening about Rottweilers is just how cute they can be, then invite them to take a look at the lovely Lola.  This account oozes with the absolute joy of dog ownership and reminds us of what a privilege it is to have these wonderful animals in our lives.</p><figure><img src='/images/rottweiler-3.jpg' alt='Rottweiler'><figcaption>Image Source: @ourgirllola on Instagram</figcaption></figure><h4 class='h4-head'>Lara (<a href='https://www.instagram.com/thescottishrottie/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@thescottishrottie</a>) – 6,674 followers</h4><p>A beautiful dog deserves a dramatic and wonderful setting.

      "<p class='first'>Social media is beginning to have a huge impact on how we live. We can see an impact in the way we communicate and connect with each other, and in how it affects other aspects of our lives--including politics, education and the economy.</p><p>The internet has given people the opportunity to connect, communicate and share their lives. However, it's also created a new way for people to share personal information and share news. It is one of the most pervasive aspects of society today. It is not uncommon for social media to be a large part of the day-to-day lives of individuals, as they use it to interact with others, stay up to date on current events and find out what is happening locally and also, globally. The number of social media users globally grew from 4.2 billion in January 2021 to 4.62 billion in January 2022. This accounts for a 10.1% growth YOY of global social media usage. It is easy to see how the world has been impacted by social media.</p><p>Social media has been around since 1997 and every year, it seems as though it is more and more involved in our daily lives. It can be difficult to avoid, and often times people actively seek long breaks due to overusing it.</p><img src='/images/socialMedia-2.jpg' alt='socialMedia' class='block m-auto object-cover'><h3 class='sub-head'>The Pros and Cons of Social Media - What is the Future?</h3><p> Social media is constantly evolving. As it evolves, the people who use it will change their behaviors and expectations of the platform. This is not always a positive thing, as it can be addictive and cause people to spend too much time on it.</p><p>The pros of social media are that it provides a way for people to stay connected with friends they have not seen in years and promote causes they care about. People also often build businesses and grow their income using social media as a tool.</p><p>The cons are that some social media platforms have become an outlet for spreading misinformation or hate speech. It can also become quite easy for people to lose their livelihoods with hackers, platform restrictions, and a more hyper-sensitive society means people might depend on their likability to make money.<p></p>There is no one answer to what the future of social media will look like, but there are some trends emerging from how people use it now: more and more people are becoming aware of the time they spend on social media, and are making efforts to cut back. Social media can be a time-consuming habit in most people's day, but some companies have started to use it as a marketing tool, resulting in an increase of time spent on these sites.<h3 class='sub-head'>What does the future hold for networking sites? Will they become irrelevant at some point?</h3><p>The rise and fall of social media is a topic that has been discussed for years. We are now at the point where we can pinpoint what went wrong with social media. The answer to this question is a lot more complicated than we might think, but there are four main reasons for the decline of social media.</p><p>The first reason for the decline in social media is how it became too much of an advertising platform. This caused people to not want to use it anymore because they were seeing ads repeatedly and did not enjoy it as much anymore. The second reason for the decline in social media was that people realized how many people were being cyber bullied on these platforms and they did not want to be a part of that anymore. The third reason was because people realized how much time they were spending.</p><p>Our personal take is that limits of usage should be a rule of thumb for the upcoming generations. Social Media does not reflect reality, and thus, we should stop letting it control our spending, lifestyle and other decisions. Use with caution.</p><img src='/images/socialMedia-5.jpg' alt='socialMedia' class='block m-auto object-cover h-[500px] w-[700px] py-4'><figcaption class='text-center'>Image credit: <a>https://www.pinterest.it/pin/810155420486716056/</a></figcaption>",

However, the process of identifying and then incorporating it into your day to day looks can seem overwhelmingly complicated.</p><p>But fear not! The goal is not out of reach. Here are some of the easiest ways of finding and practicing your own unique style.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Don’t limit yourself</h3><p>The fashion world is constantly evolving, and so are you as a person. Your tastes and interests may change as time goes on, and it’s important not to suppress them for the sake of your pre established style. So, if you like a certain colour, pattern or statement piece, don’t rule it out for the sake of a set “uniform”.</p><img src='/images/style-guide-2.jpg' alt='sytyle-guide' class='block m-auto'/> <p class='text-[12px] text-center py-1 figcaption'>Image credit:https://www.pinterest.it/pin/810155420486628877/</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Make a mood board</h3><p>There are many platforms to find fashion inspiration on, such as Pinterest and Instagram. And compiling posts of outfits, make-up looks and accessories that you like, make you feel confident, or otherwise inspire you is a great place to start finding your personal style.</p><p>You can refer back to your mood boards when deciding on an outfit, or shopping for new clothes, so that you know what you’re wearing makes you feel confident, and stylish.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Working with what you’ve got</h3><p>To quote the immortal words of Marie Kondo, “does it spark joy?” Go through your wardrobe and ask that question of every piece of clothing. Does it make you feel good when you wear it? Do you feel confident? Use the pieces you particularly like to create outfits and note down what you like about them. You can use these to figure out your style further: what colours do you like? What shapes and textures?</p><p>Conversely, note down what pieces of clothing you don’t feel comfortable in. What about them makes you dislike them? It’s important to know what to avoid when shopping, in order to keep your looks true to your style.</p><div><img src='/images/style-guide-1.jpg' alt='sytyle-guide' class='block m-auto' /> <p class='text-[12px] text-center py-1 figcaption'>Image credit:https://www.pinterest.it/pin/810155420486628877/</p></div><h3 class='sub-head'>Silhouette Supremacy</h3><p>When you’re going through your closet, pay attention to the silhouette outline of your outfits. Knowing which silhouettes make you feel the most confident is essential to finding outfits that make you feel good. Once you have the ideal type of outline in mind, your style will start to form around it, as you incorporate different patterns and shapes.</p><p>Silhouettes are the way an outfit hangs on your body: is it form-fitting or does it flow more loosely? Once you know which of these you feel the most confident in, selecting outfits becomes easier.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Inspiration & Originality</h3><p>One of the best ways to find style inspiration is to look to others. With the help of social media it’s easy to find influencers and celebrities who have unique styles and outfits. Taking some time to go through some of your favourite celebrities’ outfits is a great way to think about what sort of make-up looks, patterns and colours appeal to you.</p><p>Don’t be too worried about copying a look or being completely original: it’s very difficult to do and in a world with 7 billion people, someone is going to be dressed similarly to you. Just find what makes you feel confident and inspired!</p><img src='/images/style-guide-3.jpg' alt='style-guide' class='block m-auto'/> <p class='text-[12px] text-center py-1 figcaption'>Image credit: https://www.pinterest.it/pin/810155420486628620/</p><p>These tips should make the process of finding your personal style fun and exciting, rather than an impossible task.

    contentHeader: "The Art of Spending Valentine's Day Alone",
    content: "<p class='first'>Valentine's Day seems to approach fast, for some it may be overly exciting but for others and especially those who are single not so much... Some questions we need to ask ourselves is overall why is there so much pressure in society to have the need to have someone around to spend this day with? Valentine's Day can be just as rewarding and pleasurable to spend by yourself if managed the correct way. The following will serve you as a guide to have a self-loving day and to promote mental awareness.</p><p>For starters, a common error that people may make when thinking about Valentine's Day and the possibility of spending it alone is normally to think of negative factors instead of the positive ones. Let us not think about it as a possibility, let us think about it as an OPPORTUNITY. With Valentine&rsquo;s Day occurring slightly after the holidays, many will need time to financially recover as well as needing some alone time to themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Spending Valentine&rsquo;s Day alone can serve you as a regular self-care like no other. You want to do things that make you feel peaceful, happy, whole, satisfied, grateful and positive.&nbsp;</p><h4 class='h4-head'>Some fun activities that you can do by yourself can be the following,</h4><ul class='mb-[1rem]'><li>Go see a movie</li><li>Find a singles event</li><li>Spa day (You can also do this at home just get some facemasks, beauty treatments etc.)</li><li>Go to your favourite restaurant or bar (Let’s stop the belief that going to dinner or grabbing a drink by yourself is strange!)</li><li>Cook yourself your favourite meal or even try to cook something you have never cooked before!</li><li>Buy yourself your own flowers and chocolates.</li><li>Spend some time out of town if practical</li><li>Binge watch a new Netflix Series (The 4th season of <em>YOU</em> will be released just in time)</li><li>Find something nice to do for someone. Sometimes the best satisfaction we may get is buying doing something for someone that makes them happy. For example, giving flowers to your elderly neighbor who you know spends days alone</li><li>Go offline from social media (Remember that not everything that you see on social media shows true accuracy, some are living a far different life than what they post)</li><li>The most important activity that you can do is <strong><em>LOVE YOURSELF.</em></strong> When you&apos;re feeling alone, remember that you yourself can be your biggest supporter and that you are worthy of good feelings and love</li></ul><p><strong>A life hack that might truly save a life - </strong><em>THE CHOCOLATES AND ITEMS THAT GO ON SALE THE DAY AFTER VALENTINES DAY.</em></p><p>Honestly, don&rsquo;t just walk, RUN to your nearest store the following day and be on the lookout for all the Valentine&rsquo;s Day items that are now on sale. Items typically include chocolates as mentioned, flowers, cards, d&eacute;cor, baking goods, candy, accessories and other items! You can either stock up for the following year or simply treat yourself as you deserve it.&nbsp;</p><h4 class='h4-head'>Valentine&rsquo;s Day by yourself doesn&rsquo;t have to be invalidating.</h4>",

    contentHeader: "Interview with An Influencer - Mr Deals Manchester",
    content: "<p class='first'>Interview with Mr Deals Manchester (<a href='https://www.instagram.com/mrdealsmanchester/?hl=en'>@mrdealsmanchester</a>): </p><h4 class='text-base mt-[2rem]'>1. What inspired you to start posting on Instagram?</h4><p>I have always been good at finding deals and saving money myself - be it via discount codes, side hustles or just generally anything and everything personal finance related! I started the blog in January 2020, and I was furloughed for a few months in March 2020 which is when it kicked off a bit more!</p><h4 class='text-base'>2. What do you do when you’re not posting on Instagram?</h4><p>I spend a lot of time not doing much! I love to cook and go out to restaurants to eat (I wouldn't call myself a foodie but others would). Except that, I cycle a lot, take my dog for walks, I read and drink too much coffee! I have quite a slow pace of life, but it suits me, and that slow pace of life is littered with sporadic bursts of spontaneous energy.</p><h4 class='text-base'>3. Do you enjoy it?</h4><p>I love being able to help people on Instagram I am lucky that I can dip in and out - I am not on Instagram for the metrics (though admittedly I do keep an eye sometimes as they do help!), so whilst it may not help my engagement levels, I know that I can have a few days off and everything carries on as normal. Some days I might post 30 stories and a couple of posts, whereas other times I may go a week with barely any content at all!</p><h4 class='text-base'>4. What is your platform’s number one mission?</h4><p>The number one mission is to help people. I am never going to start selling my services as a personal finance or money coach, I am never going to harp on about crypto or investing and I will never even make a budget planner or spreadsheet to sell to you! Quite simply, my content is there to help everybody, and my DMs are always open to people who need some advice, who have a personal finance question (note - I am not an expert, so its more of a 2nd opinion than anything else) or if people just want a natter.</p><h4 class='text-base'>5. What would you like to tell people that follow you/ anyone who is reading this?</h4><p>I want you to know that you can message me at any time and I will help you if I can. I am not a financial expert, but I can offer a 2nd opinion and build on my own experience to try and help you do or understand anything personal-finance related (open to other topics too, but will be even less useful for them!)</p><h4 class='text-base'>6. If there was one thing you could change about Instagram or Social Media, what would it be?</h4><p>Lots of accounts are cloning my account to then message my followers and try to scam them. Hundreds of people have reported, or maybe even thousands by now, and yet these accounts remain active. I know many other accounts have the same issue, some with many more followers than me, and it is damaging.</p><h4 class='text-base'>7. Any advice you’d like to give to anyone reading this?</h4><p>I quite often get asked for advice and it’s difficult to give because I don't think I have some grandiose position to profess from. All I know is that my account was set up to help people and that its raison d'etre today. Whilst I am lucky to get some free food here and there or a little bit of pocket money if a new referral comes my way, that is and always will be a bonus. I think the people who follow me and engage with me know that and it is appreciated. I have lost count of the number of times people have come to me for help with referrals where they haven't used my link or code, but where they know I can and will help them. </p><h4 class='text-base'>8. How long have you been an Influencer for?</h4><p>I am not sure I am influencer even now! But after a few months of setting up the account I had amassed a couple of thousands of followers, and this is where I felt I could really help people out. Whilst the page isn't there to hit big numbers, clearly the more people following and more importantly, engaging with me, the more people I can help.</p><h4 class='text-base'>9. How did you get started? What inspired you?</h4><p>I have always been really good at finding deals and saving money myself - be it via discount codes, side hustles or just generally anything and everything personal finance related! I started the blog in January 2020, and I was furloughed for a few months in March 2020 which is when it kicked off a bit more!</p><h4 class='text-base'>10. Do you work with brands?</h4><p>Yes - every now and again. Not many days go by where I am not approached by a brand, but I say no to most things. Ultimately, for me to work with a brand it has to be a good fit for the page, and I am also a little bit conscious of whether I can add value to the brand too. So, I have refused brands because I think my page will offer no benefits for them - whilst it would be easy for me to take a quick payday here and there, it isn't good for me or my followers if my feed fills up with content that just isn't a fit for Mr Deals.</p><h4 class='text-base'>11. What do you hope people take when they visit your page?</h4><p>I hope people take at least one thing away, and ideally want to come back. I know I have followers who tell all their friends and family about me, and this is amazing because it means they think I add value to their lives and help them, and ultimately that’s all I want to do.</p>",

    content: "<p class='first'>Welcome to our first 'Book of the Month' review, where we will be featuring a different book each month to help you expand your knowledge and reach your personal development goals. For our first choice, we have selected the Atomic Habits book by James Clear.</p><p>If you're looking to make positive changes in your life, the Atomic Habits book by James Clear is an excellent resource. This book offers practical advice on how to build good habits and break bad ones, drawing on scientific research and real-world examples.</p><div class='sm:float-right'><img src='/images/atomicHabits.jfif' class='sm:w-[300px] h-[320px] object-cover pl-3 pb-3 sm:pb-0'/><p class='text-center text-[13px] pt-1'></p></div><p>Habits are the building blocks of our lives, and by focusing on small, incremental changes in our daily routines, we can transform our lives over time. In Atomic Habits, you'll learn about the 4 Laws of Behavior Change, which are designed to help you build and maintain good habits. These laws are all about making your habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. By following these laws, you can design your habits in a way that makes them much more likely to stick.</p>p>One strategy that the book promotes is 'habit stacking,' which involves adding a new habit onto an existing one. This is an effective way to build a new habit because it eliminates the need to create a new routine from scratch. Celebrating small wins and tracking progress is also incredibly motivating and can help you stay on track.</p><p>Another key takeaway from the book is the importance of environment. By creating an environment that is conducive to good habits, you can make it easier to maintain those habits over time. And, perhaps most importantly, our habits are closely tied to our identity. By making small changes to our habits, we can gradually change the way we see ourselves, which can lead to bigger changes over time.</p><p>In addition to the key takeaways we mentioned earlier, the book offers a wealth of practical tips and real-life examples that can help you to build better habits and achieve your goals. You'll learn about the different types of habits and how to design your environment to make good habits easier and bad habits harder. The book also provides actionable strategies for overcoming common obstacles such as procrastination, temptation, and lack of motivation.</p><div class='sm:float-left'><img src='/images/atomicHabits.jpg' class='sm:w-[300px] h-[320px] object-cover pr-3 pb-3 sm:pb-0'/><p class='text-center text-[13px] pt-1'></p></div><p>One of the great things about this book is its accessibility. The writing is clear and engaging, and the ideas are presented in a way that is easy to understand and apply to your own life. Whether you're looking to improve your health, increase your productivity, or achieve any other personal development goal, Atomic Habits is an excellent starting point. With its practical advice, real-life examples, and clear writing style, this book is a valuable resource that can help you to transform your life, one habit at a time.</p><p>Overall, Atomic Habits is a friendly and helpful guide to building better habits and making lasting changes in your life. By focusing on small, incremental changes and building habits that align with your goals and values, you can transform your life and achieve your full potential. So why not give it a try and see how it can help you achieve your goals?</p>",

      "Style between art form and exclusivity",
    content:
      "<p class='first'>What is style? And why is it so important to so many people? Can it boost confidence? Can it improve mental health? Can it stimulate one’s intelligence? Is it an art form?</p><p>Such broad questions call for subjective answers.</p><p>So here are MY answers.</p><p>From my point of view, passion for fashion and style is something you ought to be born with. You can learn how to dress, which colors match and  which colors, when combined, are just not as aesthetically pleasing as others. You can even follow trends and buy the latest item every other influencer has just pushed on her Instagram stories. But you’ll never be exclusive, original, or authentic.</p><p>Fashion per se has always had this sense of exclusivity. The 'inner circle' concept.</p><div class='grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-2 sm:pb-10'><div class='w-[200px]  m-auto sm:w-auto sm:h-[600px]'><img src='/images/style-2.jpg' class='object-cover h-full ' /></div><div class='w-[200px] m-auto  sm:w-auto sm:h-[600px]'><img src='/images/style-3.jpg' class=' object-cover h-full ' /><p class='text-[13px] py-2 text-center break-words'>Image credit: https://www.pinterest.it/pin/643733340494813715/</p></div></div><p>There’s an Italian saying that says “bad grapes don’t make good wine”, meaning that someone who was not born with an innate fashion instinct is not going to be able to produce a better output than someone who spent their whole life looking for and at, beauty. Along with the latter saying, another one - which I personally adore - recites “class is not water”, meaning that style is something you own, it’s a birthright. It comes easy to you even when it seems so unachievable to others. </p><p>And to stay in the realm of sayings. it would be impossible not to mention Coco Chanel's “Fashion fades, only style remains the same”,which perfectly conveys the message.</p><p>The 'either you get it or you don't' mentality is vital in the fashion world, if you do not want to be looking at it from the outside, just like an extraterrestrial would look at humans: wondering why should a Prada bag cost more than twice your monthly income. <p>So why do so many people claim it (especially among youth)?</p><p>Style makes a statement. It defines you, something you are in a desperate search for during those teen years. If you follow trends then you are cool and ‘you can sit with us’. The same goes for wearing expensive items, it makes an economic status. If you wear tailleurs, mocassins and headbands then you probably are an ambitious career woman. If you wear Venice velvet shoes and garments with no logos - but obviously very expensive - then you are probably meeting the radical chic standard style. </p><div class='grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-2 sm:pb-10'><div class='w-[200px]  m-auto sm:w-auto sm:h-[600px]'><img src='/images/style-4.jpg' class='object-cover h-full ' /><p class='text-[13px] py-2 text-center break-words'>Image credit: https://www.pinterest.it/pin/810155420486631337//</p></div><div class='w-[200px] m-auto  sm:w-auto sm:h-[600px]'><img src='/images/style-5.jpg' class=' object-cover h-full ' /></div></div><p>Is all of the above true? Maybe yes, maybe not, but likely this is what others will perceive. </p><p>Through styling different items together, it becomes possible to express one’s true self, personality, aspirations and moods.</p><p>On the one hand, this can be of help to one’s mental health by boosting confidence and by making it possible to achieve whichever version of yourself. On the other, however, this could be tricky. In fact, aiming at being another version of yourself – even if done with good intentions – means attempting at being someone else, which can be - even more - emotionally distressing. </p><p>Style is an art form indeed. One would imagine there could only be so many tasteless influencers in this world, but expectations are every day exceeded (and not in a good way). </p><p>Today, influencers all have the same style. Each of them emulates the other. There is no diversity in imitation. Only a waste of purchases (and a waste of money). We just said style should be about buying in order to make you feel confident and beautiful that picking up items based on someone else’s preferences seems like such a waste. To be fair – and not to paint everyone with the same brush – some influencers out there are truly rocking it by being fashion architect geniuses and bringing authenticity and inspiration into the industry. One example would be Giovanna Engelbert (in different looks throughout the page). </p><p>So it is an art form. Not everyone can perform it, not everyone can pick items that truly suit them. Not everyone can style them together. Not everyone can wear them.</p>",

    mainHeader: "Bruce Willis has frontotemporal dementia: What are the symptoms of FTD?",
    subHeader: "",
    contentHeader: "",
    content: "<p class='first'>Bruce Willis, the Hollywood actor who has been a household name for decades, has recently made headlines for reasons unrelated to his successful career. It has been revealed that Willis is battling frontotemporal dementia (FTD), a rare form of dementia that primarily affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.</p><p>FTD is a degenerative disorder that leads to the shrinking of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. These parts of the brain are responsible for controlling behaviour, personality, and language skills, and as they deteriorate, individuals with FTD experience a wide range of symptoms, including changes in behaviour and personality, language problems, and difficulties with movement.</p><p>While FTD is relatively rare, accounting for only around 5% of all dementia cases, it is a devastating condition that can have a profound impact on individuals and their families. There is no known cure for FTD, and treatment options are limited. However, early detection and intervention can help to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.</p><p>Willis's diagnosis has shed light on the importance of understanding and raising awareness about FTD, as well as the need for more resources and support for those affected by this condition. It is important to recognize that FTD can affect individuals of all ages, not just the elderly, and that it can have a significant impact on their ability to work, socialize, and enjoy life.<img src='/images/bruceWillis.jpg'/><p class='text-slate-400 text-sm py-3'>Photo from October of 2019 (by: <div>Charles Sykes/Charles Sykes/Invision/AP) Bruce made an appearance at a movie premiere in New York. However, just a year later, his family announced that he would be stepping away from acting due to his diagnosis with aphasia. Unfortunately, the situation has only worsened since then, and his family recently shared that his 'condition has progressed.'' They have revealed that Willis has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, a more specific and severe condition that affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.</p></div></p><p>One of the most heart-breaking consequences of FTD is the potential loss of memories and relationships. As individuals with FTD experience changes in their behaviour and personality, they may become increasingly isolated from their loved ones, and struggle to engage in the activities that they once enjoyed. In some cases, they may even forget important moments and people from their past.</p><p>For fans of Bruce Willis, the news of his diagnosis may be especially difficult to process. Many people have grown up watching his movies and admiring his work, and the thought that they may miss out on future performances is undoubtedly upsetting. However, it is also important to remember the positive impact that media can have on our lives.</p><p>Through the power of film and television, we are able to create lasting memories and share experiences with people from all over the world. Whether we are watching a classic movie like Die Hard or a new series on Netflix, the stories that we see on screen have the ability to transport us to different times and places, and to connect us with other people in meaningful ways.</p><p><div class='flex flex-col justify-center items-center'><img src='/images/bruceWillis-2.jpg' alt='bruceWillis' class='w-full max-w-[400px] block m-auto object-cover'/><a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/Cou_gFCPvjB/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=134a8602-fcd6-4b77-b7a6-6836fb00f729' target='_blank' class='py-2'>View more on Instagram</a></div></p><p>In this sense, we can be thankful for the way that we store media. While memories may fade and relationships may change, the movies and TV shows that we love remain a constant source of joy and inspiration. They remind us of the people and places that we have loved, and they help us to imagine new possibilities for the future.</p><p><div class='flex flex-col justify-center items-center'><img src='/images/bruceWillis-1.jpg' alt='bruceWillis' class='w-full max-w-[400px] block m-auto object-cover'/><a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/Cbu-T0VAukL/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=9b045030-61a1-4a50-9a4d-de7f34e4747a' target='_blank' class='py-2'>View more on Instagram</a></div></p><p>At Vell Magazine, we believe that it is important to support individuals and families affected by FTD, and to continue raising awareness about this condition. While there is much work to be done in terms of research and treatment, we can all take steps to create a more compassionate and understanding world. By recognizing the value of memories and the power of media, we can work together to make a positive difference in the lives of those affected by FTD and other conditions.</p>",

    content: "<p class='first'>The 73rd edition of the Sanremo Festival has just ended, and it left us with some very memorable moments, but most of all with some pretty iconic fashion looks.</p><p>The Sanremo Festival was born in 1951 as a national song contest that lasts one week and plays out once a year in February. Over time, the contest has evolved from just a music environment to a broader range of creative industry representatives, such as actors, comedians, journalists, and influencers. It is a very entertaining annual date to which Italians look forward at each start of the year.  Being one of the highlights of Italian television, Sanremo is one of the top opportunities for emerging artists to enhance their popularity and for fashion designers to showcase their latest works.</p>Without further ado let's talk fashion. </p><p>Here are the Most Fashionable Moments of the 2023 Sanremo Festival Edition. </p><h3>1)Chiara Ferragni</h3><div class='grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-2 '><div class='w-[200px]  m-auto sm:w-[400px]  sm:h-[500px]'><img src='/images/chiara-1.jpg' class='object-cover h-full w-full' /></div><div class='w-[200px] m-auto  sm:w-[400px] sm:h-[500px]'><img src='/images/chiara-2.jpg' class=' object-cover h-full w-full' /></div><p class='text-[13px] py-2 text-center break-words col-span-2'>Image credit: Instagram - @chiaraferragni</p></div><p>The first one on our list has to be <b>Chiara Ferragni</b>, Italy’s very own Kylie Jenner (in terms of influencer popularity, not looks of course).  Chiara is a blogger, businesswoman, fashion designer, and model, who gained her popularity through her website “The Blonde Salad”.</p><p>On the opening night of the festival, she wanted to send a very strong message to women against hate, violence, and sexism. The first one is called “The Manifesto Dress”, designed by Dior, with a stole reciting “Think of yourself as free”. The message is directed at women who are tired of having to fit in with society-imposed roles. The second one, also custom-made by Dior, was named “The Shameless dress”, giving the illusion of nudity, and standing against the objectification of women's bodies. </p><div class='grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-2 '><div class='w-[200px]  m-auto sm:w-[400px]  sm:h-[500px]'><img src='/images/chiara-3.jpg' class='object-cover h-full w-full' /></div><div class='w-[200px] m-auto  sm:w-[400px] sm:h-[500px]'><img src='/images/chiara-4.jpg' class=' object-cover h-full w-full' /></div><p class='text-[13px] py-2 text-center break-words col-span-2'>Image credit: Instagram - @chiaraferragni</p></div><p>Chiara also wore a black Schiaparelli dress with a womb-shaped golden necklace representing reproductive rights. Finally, in our last selected look, “The Cage Dress”, designed once again by Dior, alludes to women who want to break free from their patriarchy-assigned roles. She is intentionally depicted with her daughter who represents the fact that this hope that lies in the next generation of women. </p><h3>2)	Elodie </h3><div class='grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-x-2 '><div class='w-[200px]  m-auto sm:w-[400px]  sm:h-[500px]'><img src='/images/elodie-1.jpg' class='object-cover h-full w-full' /></div><div class='w-[200px] m-auto  sm:w-[400px] sm:h-[500px]'><img src='/images/elodie-2.jpg' class=' object-cover h-full w-full' /></div><p class='text-[13px]  text-center break-words '>Image credit: Instagram - @maisonvalentino</p><p class='text-[13px]  text-center break-words '>Image credit: https://www.vogue.it/moda/article/look-elodie-sanremo-2023</p></div><p><b>Elodie</b> is an Italian singer, actress, and model. She also appeared in the Vogue Italia 2023 February edition. Her best two looks for the Sanremo 2023 Festival included a Valentino birdie look, seen in Pierpaolo Piccioli’s latest fashion show. For the closing night, she wore a very trending Versace gothic-chic look with a single-laced glove sleeve. </p><h3>3)Mara Sattei</h3><div class='grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-x-2 '><div class='w-[200px]  m-auto sm:w-[400px]  sm:h-[500px]'><img src='/images/mara-1.jpg' class='object-cover h-full w-full' /></div><div class='w-[200px] m-auto  sm:w-[400px] sm:h-[500px]'><img src='/images/mara-2.jpg' class=' object-cover h-full w-full' /></div><p class='text-[13px]  text-center break-words '>Image credit: https://www.vanityfair.it/gallery/sanremo-2023-mara-sattei-abito-outfit-look-vestito-giorgio-armani-prive</p><p class='text-[13px]  text-center break-words '>Image credit: Instagram - @mara.sattei</p></div><p><b>Mara Sattei</b> is an Italian singer-songwriter.

    content: "<p class='first'>The beauty industry has seen a recent shift towards 'clean beauty,'' a term used to describe products made with natural, non-toxic ingredients that are better for both the consumer and the environment. This trend has become particularly popular in recent years, with a growing number of consumers seeking out beauty products that are free from harmful chemicals and synthetic ingredients. One country that has played a major role in the clean beauty movement is South Korea, a country known for its innovative and effective beauty products.</p><p>Korean beauty, also known as K-beauty, has gained a huge following in recent years thanks to its emphasis on natural, high-quality ingredients. Many of these ingredients are derived from traditional Korean medicine, which has been used for centuries to promote healthy skin and hair. Korean beauty products are also known for their innovative and often quirky packaging, making them a fun addition to any beauty routine.</p><p>One of the key principles of Korean beauty is the importance of maintaining a healthy skin barrier. This involves using products that help to hydrate and nourish the skin, while also protecting it from environmental stressors. Many K-beauty products are made with ingredients like green tea, ginseng, and snail mucin, which are known for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.</p><p>The popularity of K-beauty has also had a global impact on the beauty industry, with many other countries and brands now adopting similar clean beauty principles. This has led to a wider range of clean beauty products on the market, making it easier than ever for consumers to find natural, non-toxic options for their beauty routine.</p><p>However, it's important to note that not all 'clean' beauty products are created equal, and there is still some debate over what exactly constitutes a 'clean' product. It's always a good idea to do your research and read ingredient labels carefully, as some products marketed as 'clean' may still contain potentially harmful ingredients.</p><p>In addition to the rise of clean beauty, another trend that has taken the beauty world by storm in recent years is 'clean makeup.' This trend has gained traction on social media, with platforms like TikTok featuring a growing number of influencers and creators showcasing their favourite natural, non-toxic makeup products.</p><p>Clean makeup is all about using products that are free from harmful chemicals and synthetic ingredients, while still providing effective coverage and colour payoff. This can include products like natural foundation, non-toxic lipstick, and mineral-based eyeshadows.</p><img src='/images/koreanskincare-2.jfif' class='object-cover h-[400px] sm:float-left sm:pr-5 p-2'/><p>On TikTok, creators have been sharing their favourite clean makeup products and tutorials for achieving a variety of looks, from natural, everyday makeup to bold and colourful looks. The popularity of these videos has helped to fuel interest in clean makeup and has inspired many consumers to seek out more natural, non-toxic options for their beauty routine.</p><p>One of the key benefits of clean makeup is that it can be gentler on the skin, particularly for those with sensitive skin or allergies to certain ingredients. Many clean makeup products are formulated with natural, plant-based ingredients like aloe vera, jojoba oil, and shea butter, which can help to soothe and nourish the skin while providing coverage.</p><p>Of course, as with any beauty trend, it's important to do your research and make sure that the products you're using are truly 'clean' and free from harmful ingredients. Some brands may use misleading marketing tactics to make their products appear more natural than they are, so it's always a good idea to read ingredient labels and do your own research on a brand's reputation and sourcing practices.</p><p>Overall, the rise of clean makeup and the influence of social media platforms like TikTok has helped to bring more attention to natural, non-toxic beauty products. Whether you're a long-time fan of clean beauty or just starting to explore this trend, there are plenty of options out there to help you look and feel your best while minimizing your exposure to potentially harmful chemicals.</p>",

      "<p class='first'>Today in VMagaziine we are going to hop into the world of rabbit influencers. There is a whole warren of rabbits who have come out of their hutches to enter the world of influencing. Not only this, but marketers and businesses have been very keen to put the bunny into their brands.</p><p>This should come as no surprise as, after all, are there any animals out there with floppier ears or twitchier noses?</p><p>In the UK rabbits are the third most popular pet after cats and dogs.  In recent years there has been a shift from seeing them as just a cute, almost ornamental little pet for the kids.  Rather they have become rightly appreciated for being intelligent companion pets with bags of personality.  And accounts on Instagram and TikTok have certainly promoted the idea that getting a rabbit leads to lots of floppy-eared fun and great hoppiness.</p><p>So, unlike Neo in The Matrix, we are not just going to follow the white rabbit, but rather we are going to recommend becoming a follower of a range of rabbits, of all colours, breeds, shapes and sizes.</p><p>But before that we are going to burrow into a brief history of rabbits and what they have come to mean to us.</p><div class=bunnies><figure><img src='/images/bunny-1.jpg' alt='bunny'></figure></div><h3 class='sub-head'>A Brief History of Rabbits</h3><p>Although it is thought that rabbits have been around since 4000BC, it was the Romans who started farming them in around 200BC for their meat and fur.</p><p>As the Roman Empire expanded and fell rabbits were introduced across Europe and wild populations expanded in habits favourable to them.  Rabbits were so successful at establishing themselves that their tendency to produce so many offspring led to the term to ‘breed like rabbits’ whenever a family had many children.</p><p>The bunnies finally arrived in Britain in around the 12th century.  Although still largely farmed for food, ‘rabbit stew’ being a popular medieval dish for rich and poor alike, pictorial and written records suggest that it was at this time their irresistible cuteness led them to be kept as pets by the aristocratic classes, a tradition which fully blossomed in the Victorian era.</p><p>The popularity of caring and tending for rabbits as pets led to different breeds being developed in different parts of Europe: from the Flemish Giant (in what is now Belgium) to dwarf breeds like the diminutive Polish rabbit</p><figure><img src='/images/bunny-2.jpg' alt='bunny'><figcaption>The Easter Bunny represents new life and therefore offers a symbol of renewal both for Spring and the Christian idea of resurrection <br/> (Image Source: Canva)</figcaption></figure><h3 class='sub-head'>The Easter Bunny</h3><p>In our modern culture, bunnies really come into their own at Easter.  According to tradition it is rabbits who run around delivering chocolate eggs layered in shiny colourful foil.</p><p>This is thought to have originally been a German tradition of an “Oschter Haws”, a hare which brought eggs home to her children.</p><p>More widely the fact that rabbits breed so quickly also chimed in with the idea of the new life of spring, as well as the renewal of life which the resurrection of Jesus celebrates.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>The Bunnies of Instagram</h3><p>Don’t just follow the white rabbit, follow them all!</p><p>Well rabbits have also spread around social media, well, like rabbits.   And we say that the virtual world is better for it!</p><p>We have already noticed that the Pet space in Instagram and other social media platforms has become a bit of a beacon for charity and for promoting the welfare of animals.  This is also very true of accounts relating to all things rabbit.</p><h4 class='h4-head'><a href='https://www.instagram.com/bunnymama/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@bunnymama</a>   622K Followers on Instagram</h4><figure><img src='/images/bunny-3.jpg' alt='bunny'><figcaption>Image Source: @bunnymama on Instagram</figcaption></figure><p>This adorable account follows the adventures of three rescue rabbits who are real heartbreakers.  It is a sad fact that rabbits are often bought as a cute gift for children without realising that these are pets who require both commitment and understanding.</p><p>The posts are also scattered with useful tips and hints of how to care for your  bunnies and give them their best life.</p><h4 class='h4-head'><a href='https://www.instagram.com/sincerelycinnabun/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@sincerelycinnabun</a> 66.3K Followers on Instagram</h4><figure><img src='/images/bunny-4.jpg' alt='bunny'><figcaption>Image Source: @sincerelycinnabun on Instagram</figcaption></figure><p>Cinnabun is both cute by name, and cute by nature.  This endearing rabbit, named after is free roaming which means just like a cat or dog, Cinnabun has a free pass around the house.  This is a great way for a bunny to develop relationships with the whole family.</p><p>Cinnabun and her ‘bunmom’ Morgan offer an account fully of fluffy fun.  But at the same time are very serious about rabbit welfare.  As Morgan reminded her followers last Easter: “o while it may be fun to pose with our little fur babies on this bunny themed day, remember to always do your research before bringing one of us home!”</p><h4 class='h4-head'><a href='https://www.instagram.com/ollieandermie/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@OllieandErmie</a>  74.8K Followers</h4><figure><img src='/images/bunny-5.jpg' alt='bunny'><figcaption>Image Source: @OlliandErmie on Instagram</figcaption></figure><p>This twitchy-nosed twosome are known on this account as ‘Grumpy King Ollie’ and ‘Sassy Queen Ermie’ and are based in the UK.</p><p>My personal favourite post on this account wishes us “a hoppy molty bunny butt Friday’.  I don’t think this celebration will ever get as big as Easter, but I do hope that it catches on.</p><h4 class='h4-head'><a href='https://www.instagram.com/cleo_thebunny/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@cleo_thebunny</a>    22.9K Followers</h4><figure><img src='/images/bunny-6.jpg' alt='bunny'><figcaption>Image Source: @cleo_thebunny on Instagram</figcaption></figure><p>This beautiful black-eyed bunny offers a wonderful example of an English Angora rabbit.  This breed of rabbit is known for its luxuriantly long hair which also sprouts endearingly from their ears.</p><p>The English Angora is known to have a calm and balanced temperament and Cleo is no exception.  It’s quite therapeutic to watch her spend most of her days happily munching away on various vegetables.</p><h4 class='h4-head'><a href='https://www.instagram.com/bunnymelv/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@bunnymelv</a> 180K Followers</h4><figure><img src='/images/bunny-7.jpg' alt='bunny'><figcaption>A very important message from bunnymelv (Source: @bunnymelv on Instagram)</figcaption></figure><p>This account is the virtual hutch of the rabbits Bianca and Melvin, who are based in scenic Switzerland.</p><p>They are free roam bunnies who can often be seen zooming excitedly round the house and garden.</p><p>These two seem to take bunny cuteness to a whole new level.  They may look like cuddly toys but the owner of this account is very clear that these are actually a ’10 year commitment’.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>A world of happy bunnies</h3><p>Forget about being ambassadors for brands, the lovely thing about these accounts is how they are ambassadors for these wonderful little animals.</p><p>All of these influencers promote awareness that these little furries are clever, complex and companionable animals who deserve homes that fully respect this.</p><p>In fact, the stark advice from <a href='https://www.instagram.com/bunnymelv/?hl=en' target='_blank'>@bunnymelv</a> offers the perfect way to conclude this rabbit roundup:</p><p>“Thousands of bunnies are impulsively purchased as gifts to children only to be abandoned or left at shelters a few months later”.</p><p>So, in accordance with this advice, let’s hope to see as many rabbits out there as happy bunnies in caring and understanding homes.</p>",

      "<p class='first'>Summer 2022 was an eventful one. One particular occasion that made it so memorable was a circumstance that I got selected for, as in randomly extracted from a large group of people from all over the country. </p><p>7<sup>th</sup> of June. I walk into a Sephora store at 7:40 pm in the center of Rome, in a black crop top, black elegant tailor-made trousers, black suede Steven Madden open-toe heels, and a flamboyant ocher Bvlgari twilly scarf. I was elegantly dressed as I was attending a close friend’s birthday party, however, per my usual Italian lateness, I had forgotten to buy my dear friend a gift (mainly because I was way too focused on my outfit for the night). </p><p>Sephora was going to close in less than 20 minutes so I had little time to choose between products and I did something I am not usually fond of: I asked a shop assistant for an opinion. He gave me a couple of options based on my budget and product orientation and added that if I were to purchase one of the two, I was going to enter a contest in which a few girls would have won a Make-Up Masterclass by NARS Italia. And, since I was already in a hurry, I purchased the latter, almost without even letting him finish talking.</p><p>1<sup>st</sup> of July. I receive an email from the marketing department of NARS Italia informing me that I was extracted as a winner of the Makeup Masterclass contest, so I confirm my participation. In the email, they explained how the day was going to be structured: brunch and introductions, a 2,5h masterclass on how to apply NARS makeup, and an aperitivo to end the day. Everything was going to be free and hosted in one of the most beautiful villas in the center of Rome: Residenza Lavernale. Convinced that it was going to be the typical event full of teenage girls that were going to Instagram every moment and that the masterclass would consist of a PowerPoint presentation, I invited my boyfriend. At first, he was not thrilled about participating in a 2,5h makeup masterclass, but he was quickly convinced when the free aperitivo was mentioned. </p><p>8<sup>th</sup> of July. My boyfriend and I – properly dressed – arrive at the location and were enchanted by the beautiful atmosphere surrounding us. A private oasis in the middle of Rome. When we get closer to the glazed residence I immediately notice that things were far more different than I had imagined. I see a massive rectangular table with eight workstations, each equipped with a notebook, pen, foundation, palette, mascara, makeup removal, etc. Conversely to what I had thought, it was an extremely private event. A whole catering team was there to serve us, standing waiters in uniforms serving us never-ending food. Amazing and unexpected at the same time. Out of embarrassment, I tell my boyfriend (who was already at the buffet eating) that I was not going to keep him if he had changed his mind about staying, but he did not leave. In the meantime, the same person from the Marketing Department who had sent me the email welcomed us and presented us with the Brand Manager of NARS Italia. I also recognized the shop assistant who helped me pick up my friend’s gift a month earlier. To my surprise, NARS’s Brand Manager was delighted by my boyfriend’s presence and vouched for him to stay since one of the girls bailed last minute. In short, my boyfriend got a seat at the winners' table and did not even participate in the contest. </p><p>The next two hours were truly enriching from a personal and cultural point of view. They showed us how to apply makeup as we did it ourselves (a very effective way for people to remember stuff), we girls put on a few things more but also my boyfriend was taught how to put foundation, concealer, and the “lighter” kind of makeup to help him look less tired. In addition, the NARS representative kindly explained how there are makeup products made exclusively for men and that there is an in-depth psychology study behind them. For instance, makeup and creams for men are more liquid - compared to women’s - as they have to dry faster since men are not at ease with the feeling of something covering their faces. In contrast, women prefer the latter feeling, otherwise, they will not believe the product to be effective.</p><img src='/images/makigUpWithBoyfriend-4.jpg' class='object-cover block m-auto'/><p>Moreover, he explored a bit of history and mentioned: “Boy de Chanel”, which is the male makeup line launched in 2018 by Chanel: mattifying toner, moisturizing foundation, a lip balm, and a pencil for defining facial hair and brows. Or Marc Jacobs’ peculiarly named “Boy Tested, Girl Approved” male makeup collection.</p><p>Finally, he told us a little bit about himself and his story, from starting at Central Saint Martins as a fashion designer to working as a celebrity makeup artist to then moving into a quieter home just outside of Milan. A fascinating man with an incredible ability to put at ease his interlocutors. Bottom line, I arrived at the event embarrassed about having brought my boyfriend with me to leave a fun makeup session wearing, both me and my boyfriend, DIY (plus a little bit of help) NARS makeup.</p><p>We had our aperitivo, engaged in a few social conversations, took a few pictures, and left.</p><p>Overall it was a great day and to top it off since I had to use the restroom we found one in a church nearby and accidentally – by exiting the wrong way – we found that behind the church, a temporary theatre set-up – with the most amazing Roman view - was going to present Luigi Pirandello’s play “Six Characters in search for an Author”, so we stayed. A magic day. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>",

      "<p class='first'>This season's London Fashion Week has overcome many challenges as the city commemorates Queen Elizabeth II's life and legacy. As 2022 comes to a close, we're preparing for Spring/Summer 2023 with the hottest makeup and beauty trends.</p><p>This season was full of breathtaking makeup touches that wowed fashion enthusiasts both on and off the catwalks. London Fashion Week SS23 did not disappoint, from a pop of colours to bright shades, berry lips, and sparkling glitter! </p><p>Is it time to revamp and boost your makeup routine? Keep an eye on Brits' beauty inspirations! Read on to discover this season's fascinating makeup trends from London.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Brow Lamination</h3><div><img src='/images/londonFashion.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'>Photo: Alex Soroka - Courtesy of Isamaya</p></div><p>The brow lamination trend has already taken off and will continue to snowball in Spring/Summer 2023, but with a twist! The classic approach to brows at Poster Girl has been reimagined in favor of accentuated, razor-cut brows by makeup artist Isamaya Ffrench, while fluffy, brushed-up brows have been very much in vogue recently. So how far you take the brow shape next season is up to you!</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Embellished Disco Eyes</h3><div><img src='/images/londonFashion-2.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'> Photographed by Acielle/StyleDuMonde</p></div><p>Regarding SS23 beauty trends, embellished eyes are here to stay. Halpern and Mark Fast used mixed bright highlighter colours with geometric shapes and jewels to enhance the eye look at Paul and Joe. Also, keep the skin fresh and radiant with a skin tint and a 'your lips but better' subtle shine to give the style a new spring/summer touch.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Berry Lips</h3><div><img src='/images/londonFashion-3.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'>Nick England - BFC - Getty Images</p></div><p>Cherry red lips were reserved for cooler winter days, but they’re more likely to become a year-round love affair this time. During this fashion week, the strong lip style was matched with brushed-up, fluffy brows and barely eye makeup that let the lips do the talking, ranging from nearly black to raspberry colours.</p><p><strong>A small tip:</strong> To keep your lipstick in place all day, use a lip pencil around the borders of your mouth, or dab the edges with your finger for an undone look.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Laminated Skin</h3><div><img src='/images/londonFashion-4.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'> Photo by Jacqueline Kilikita</p></div><p>Highlighters are about more than just brightened cheekbones or powdered, glittering finishes in Spring/Summer 2023. It's about making a 'hyper-moisturized' and 'laminated' base, as described by Terry Barber, MAC's director of makeup artistry. </p><p>Everyone can benefit from glossy, laminated skin; even acne-prone and uneven skin. It's only a matter of adapting your skin to it. Before applying makeup, avoid using an oily base and use a lightweight gel moisturizer instead.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Bleached Brows</h3><div><img src='/images/londonFashion-5.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'>Photographed by Acielle/StyleDuMonde</p></div><p>If you've been following fashion runways, you'll notice that brow trends change with each season. And this Spring/Summer 2023 is all about bare brows!</p><p>Want to try the look without bleaching your brows? Use the creamiest concealer in a slightly lighter shade, then use a spoolie to coat them once or twice. It will give you an idea of how your face would look if you follow that route.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Colour Flash</h3><div><img src='/images/londonFashion-6.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'>Victor Virgile - Getty Images</p></div><p>A full-eye look full of colours can be too much for many, but that’s not a problem because a quick swipe of pastel shadow or liner is a gorgeous way to play with colour this season.</p><p>You can go for the inner or outer corners of the eye is a striking beauty statement easily done and can 100% work for day or evening. Purple shades were highly noticed on the London catwalks, but blue or green shades were noticed on various street style stars.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>A Pop of Glitter</h3><div><img src='/images/londonFashion-7.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'>Nick England- BFC - Getty Images</p></div><p>We've seen glitter used in make-up before, but it appears that the bursts of glitter during New York Fashion Week leaped across the pond this season, with numerous designers prepping their models for the catwalk in various shades of shine. Of course, there is no limit to how much glitter you'll use this season, so the more, the merrier!</p>",

      "<p class='first'>Acne: the world’s most common skincare struggle. Ways to combat it vary - there are countless products on the market designed to clean the pores and banish blemishes, with varying degrees of success. </p><p>But having an extensive skin care routine isn’t always a viable option in the hectic, busy world we live in, especially with the current cost of living crisis, which is seeing the price of beauty products soar. So here are 5 alternative ways to treat acne from the inside out.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Hormone Hacks</h3><p>Hormone imbalance is a contributor to the acne issues some people face, especially because of unbalanced oestrogen. Excess oestrogen stimulates oil production, giving rise to clogged pores and flare ups. </p><p>To avoid oestrogen dominance, you can reduce the amount of processed foods you eat, as they often contain high levels of oestrogen. Eating fibrous foods to help excrete excess oestrogen from the body is also an effective way to combat oestrogen over-production.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>A Carrot A Day…</h3><p>Carrots are packed with high levels of vitamin A and beta-carotene (this gives the carrot their orange colour). Both can reduce inflammation of the skin and encourage regular cell turnover (the skin exfoliating itself). </p><p>Additionally, carrots contain lots of fibre, which helps the body excrete excess oestrogen (which, as noted earlier is a common cause of acne). This works because if the bowels don’t move regularly, oestrogen meant to be excreted gets reabsorbed into the bile. Fibre, known for helping bowels stay healthy, is key to keeping oestrogen levels down. Eating a raw carrot daily is said to be the best way to see results quickly.</p><div><img src='/images/abolishingAcne-1.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'>Image Credit: https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/carrot-juice-benefits</p></div><h3 class='sub-head'>Dairy Decrease</h3><p>Dairy products can contain hormones that throw off your body’s natural balance, which as established before can lead to issues with excess oil production. There’s no need to cut dairy out of your diet completely: it’s a good source of vitamin D, which is vital for skin repair, cell growth and protection. But if you’re having issues with acne and have a dairy heavy diet, try reducing the amount for a month and look for changes in your complexion.</p><div><img src='/images/abolishingAcne-2.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'>Image Credit: https://deliciouslysavvy.com/what-to-know-about-cutting-out-dairy/</p></div><h3 class='sub-head'>Balance your blood sugar</h3><p>Insulin (the hormone that reduces your blood sugar levels after eating) can in excess contribute to acne breakouts. This is because it can lead to chronic inflammation, blocking pores and making the skin prone to acne.</p><p>To balance your blood sugar levels, make sure you’re eating plenty of healthy (unprocessed) fats. Fat slows down the absorption of glucose into the bloodstream through insulin and prevents sugar highs and sugar crashes. This reduces insulin levels, preventing it from inflaming the skin.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>Hydrate</h3><p>Drinking plenty of water can improve just about everything, from your mood to your overall health. This goes for acne too, as when your skin is properly hydrated, the pores don’t need to produce excess oil to moisturise the skin. Reducing oil production reduces the risk of your pores getting clogged and forming acne.</p>Acne can seem like an undefeatable issue without being able to navigate the ever growing, ever more costly market of skincare products. But it is possible to have healthy skin through a balanced diet and body.</p><div><img src='/images/abolishingAcne-3.jpg' class='block m-auto h-[400px] object-cover'/><p class='text-sm text-center py-2'>Image Credit: https://sflcn.com/how-to-soften-your-water-in-south-florida/</p></div>",

    content: "<p class='first'><span>Bright and eclectic colours have made a comeback in the fashion industry during the past few years. We see them everywhere, on celebrities, during Fashion Weeks and in the streets. They come in every shape and form, from shoes to shirts, from sunglasses to bags. Either you want to wear it as a </span><em>pop of colour</em><span>, total black outfit with a bright pink bag, </span><em>touch of exaggeration </em><span>or as a </span><em>mix &amp; match </em><span>of beautiful fluorescent colours, (almost) anything goes. </span></p><p><span>A study reported that, in the digital age, the three most attractive colours, in relevance to fashion, out of the Pantone colours are Black, Pink Yarrow and Blazing Yellow (Kodžoman et al., 2022). Contray to previous studies stating the preferred colours were blue and red, and that the least favorite were green and yellow.<div class='grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-2 '><div class='w-[200px]  m-auto sm:w-auto sm:h-[600px]'><img src='/images/celebrating-colours-2.jpg' class='object-cover h-full ' /></div><div class='w-[200px] m-auto  sm:w-auto sm:h-[600px]'><img src='/images/celebrating-colours-3.jpg' class=' object-cover h-full ' /></div></div> </span></p><p><span>Apart from the astonishing combinations, bright colours have also been proven to have a positive impact on mental health. In fact, black outfits are commonly associated with a sad feeling, whereas colorful ones are linked to happier feelings. Orange makes you feel energized and enthusiastic. Red makes you feel passionate. Yellow makes you feel happy and spontaneous. Green makes you feel optimistic and refreshed. Blue makes you feel safe and relaxed. Purple makes you feel creative. Pink makes you feel playful and romantic. Black feels sophisticated, classic and serious. White means minimalism and simplicity and Gray feels professional. However, it is worth mentioning that color associations are subjective and can vary from person to person depending on life experiences. </span></p><p><span>Finally, colours in fashion can be an new exciting way of choosing and defining your personality each day, allowing you to make a bold and loud statement. </span></p>",

The second part, "Service," delves into his time in the military and how that shaped him as a person. Finally, the third part, "Duty," explores his time as a senior member of the royal family and the reasons behind his decision to step back from that role.</p><div class="sm:float-right"><img src="/images/spare.jpg" class="sm:w-[300px] h-[450px] object-cover pl-3 pb-3 sm:pb-0"/><p class="text-center text-[13px] pt-1"></p></div><p>Throughout the book, Prince Harry reflects on his experiences and offers insights into how he has navigated the challenges of his unique position.

    content: "<p class='first'>Adidas dropped Kanye West's Yeezy brand after his antisemitic comments last year, but the controversy seems to have driven demand for the sneakers. The Yeezy sneakers are now one of the top three sellers on Impossible Kicks, a large online reseller of high-end sneakers and clothing. &quot;Demand for Yeezys has surged 30% since last October-November,&quot; said John Mocadlo, CEO of Impossible Kicks.</p><img src='/images/kanye-1.jpg' alt='kanye' class='block m-auto'/> <p class='text-[12px] text-center py-1 figcaption'>Image from unsplash.com</p><p>Yeezy sneakers are among the most popular brands on the platform after Jordans and other Nike footwear, including Dunk and Air Max shoes. Impossible Kicks sells around 30,000 sneakers in total every month, with approximately 6,000 to 7,000 of those being Yeezys.</p><p>The Yeezy 350 with black and white in the shoe's color pattern is among the most sought-after at resale, priced 20% to 40% above the shoe's retail value, according to Mocadlo. The resale price for those two options ranges from $350 to $400. The increased sales of Yeezy's at resale wouldn't benefit West because the secondary market represents items that were already purchased.</p><img src='/images/yeezy-2.jpg' alt='kanye' class='block m-auto'/> <p class='text-[12px] text-center py-1 figcaption'>Image from <a href='https://news.adidas.com/'>https://news.adidas.com/</a></p><p>Mocadlo stated that many customers hoping to score Yeezy sneakers view them as collector's items, hoping to see a further increase in value. While others simply like their style and comfort and want to add them to their wardrobe. He added that many customers are unaware of the controversy tied to the brand's designer. &quot;I'm very surprised by that,&quot; he said.</p><p>Adidas, which had been working with West since 2013 to produce and market his Yeezy brand, wasn't the only company to cut ties with him. The fallout extended to Gap, Footlocker, TJ Maxx, and Balenciaga, all of which stopped selling Yeezy merchandise.</p><p>Earlier this month, Adidas said it expects to lose $1.3 billion in revenue this year after ending its nine-year partnership with West, leaving the company stuck with a lot of unsold Yeezy-branded merchandise. The company said it would try to repurpose some of it without the Yeezy branding.</p><p>Impossible Kicks has about $2 million in Yeezy sneaker inventory currently, approximately 10,000 pairs. &quot;It is getting a little bit difficult to get more because the inventory is starting to dry up after the controversy,&quot; said Mocadlo.</p><img src='/images/kanye-2.jpg' alt='kanye' class='block m-auto'/> <p class='text-[12px] text-center py-1 figcaption'>Image from <a href='https://runthetrap.com/'>https://runthetrap.com/</a></p><p>Prices for Yeezy sneakers are now climbing due to tighter supply, according to StockX, a leading sneaker resale platform. &quot;Since the start of the year, the average price of Yeezy sneakers has increased, but sales overall have decreased on StockX,&quot; said Drew Haines, director of sneakers and collectibles at StockX. &quot;This is in line with the principles of supply and demand and consistent with what we'd expect to happen when no new supply is in the market.&quot; StockX declined to comment specifically on demand for Yeezy sneakers on its platform.</p>",

    contentHeader: "What's the Value of Viral Fashion?",
    content: "<p class='first'>The fashion industry is currently more focused than ever on creating hype, but a few brands are reconsidering their reliance on marketing gimmicks. In recent years, the fashion industry has shifted its focus from creating classic, timeless pieces to generating buzz and creating viral moments. Many brands rely heavily on marketing stunts to capture the attention of consumers and generate hype around their products. However, some industry experts are questioning the value of viral fashion and whether it truly leads to increased sales and brand loyalty.</p><p>One example of a brand that has rethought its dependence on marketing stunts is Balenciaga. In 2018, the brand released a viral item - a bright yellow oversized puffer jacket that was seen on countless street style stars and influencers. While the jacket generated a lot of buzz, it was ultimately a commercial flop, with many customers balking at its high price tag and impracticality. Since then, Balenciaga has shifted its focus to creating more wearable, timeless pieces, and its sales have reportedly rebounded.</p><p>Another brand that has questioned the value of viral fashion is Vetements. The brand, known for its avant-garde designs and streetwear aesthetic, has become synonymous with viral moments, from its DHL t-shirts to its &quot;No Social Media&quot; collection. However, in a 2020 interview with Vogue, Vetements co-founder Guram Gvasalia admitted that the brand had &quot;overplayed&quot; its hand with these stunts and that it was time to focus on creating more meaningful pieces that would stand the test of time.</p><h3 class='sub-head'>When do we decide Viral fashion has gone too far?</h3><p>Last year, Balenciaga came under fire for an ad campaign that many found disturbing. The ads featured children holding bags that resembled teddy bears, but with studs and harnesses, alongside adult items like wine glasses.</p><p>In a recent interview with Vogue, <strong>Demna</strong>, formerly known as <strong>Demna Gvasalia</strong>, spoke publicly for the first time about the controversial ad campaign. The campaign sparked outrage as it appeared to reference child abuse. Demna apologized for the campaign and explained that the bears were intended to be a reference to punk, not BDSM.</p><p>Although Balenciaga announced that it would sue the company that shot the campaign, Demna acknowledged that he did not know if the reference to child abuse was intentional or not. He expressed regret and stated that the episode fundamentally changed his approach to work, which had previously <em>involved high-profile celebrity endorsements and provocative promotions.</em></p><p>Of course, not all brands are abandoning viral fashion. Off-White, the brainchild of designer Virgil Abloh, has built its entire brand on generating buzz and creating viral moments. From its industrial belt to its &quot;FOR WALKING&quot; boots, Off-White’s designs are often more about making a statement than they are about practicality. And yet, the brand’s sales continue to soar, proving that there is still a market for viral fashion.</p><img src='/images/viral-fashion-2.jpg' alt='kanye' class='block m-auto'/> <p class='text-[12px] text-center py-1 '>OFF-WHITE’s “For -Walking” Sneakers (off---white.com)</p><p>So what is the value of viral fashion? On one hand, it can certainly generate buzz and put a brand in the spotlight. On the other hand, it’s key for brands to consider whether this type of hype is sustainable and whether it actually leads to increased sales and brand loyalty.</p><p>As Balenciaga and Vetements have shown, relying too heavily on viral fashion can be a risky strategy. The key to success in the fashion industry is creating pieces that are both innovative and timeless - items that will stand the test of time and continue to be relevant long after the hype has died down.</p>",

    content: "<p class='first'>Beyoncé is known for her talent not only as a singer and performer, but also as a businesswoman. Her collaboration with Adidas for her athleisure brand, Ivy Park, was highly anticipated and received critical acclaim upon its launch. However, recent reports suggest that the future of Ivy Park may be uncertain due to missed sales projections.</p><p>According to sources, Adidas had high hopes for Ivy Park's second collection, which was released in October 2020. The collection featured a wide range of products, from sneakers to leggings to oversized jackets. Despite the hype surrounding the release, Ivy Park failed to meet Adidas' sales expectations.</p><p>While the exact sales figures have not been disclosed, it is rumoured that Ivy Park only sold around half of what Adidas had projected. This is a significant blow to the brand, as Adidas had reportedly invested millions of dollars into the collaboration with Beyoncé.</p><p>As a result of the missed sales projections, the future of Ivy Park remains uncertain. Some speculate that Adidas may not renew their partnership with Beyoncé when the current contract expires. Others believe that Ivy Park may need to make significant changes to its business strategy in order to improve sales.</p><div class='grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-2 '><div class='w-[200px]  m-auto sm:w-auto sm:h-[600px]'><img src='/images/beyonce-2.jpg' class='object-cover h-full' /></div><div class='w-[200px]  m-auto sm:w-auto sm:h-[600px]'><img src='/images/beyonce-3.jpg' class='object-cover h-full' /></div></div><figcaption class='text-center pb-[1rem]'> Photos from <a href='https://beyonce.com/'>Beyonce.com</a></figcaption><p>Despite these setbacks, Beyoncé has remained committed to Ivy Park and has continued to promote the brand on social media.

    content: "<p class='first'>The fashion and modeling industry is glamorous and exciting, but it also comes with its unique set of challenges. Models are often subjected to intense scrutiny and pressure to maintain certain standards of beauty, which can take a toll on their mental health. The industry's cut-throat competition, long hours, and irregular work schedules can also be difficult to navigate, leading to exhaustion and burnout.</p><p>To address these issues, several organizations have been working to improve the mental health and well-being of models. While there is still much work to be done, the fashion industry is gradually becoming more aware of the importance of prioritizing mental health. In this article, we'll be exploring 10 ways the modeling industry is prioritizing mental health, from providing resources and support to challenging beauty standards.</p><p>To address these issues, several organizations have been working to improve the mental health and well-being of models. While there is still much work to be done, the fashion industry is gradually becoming more aware of the importance of prioritizing mental health. In this article, we&apos;ll be exploring 10 ways the modeling industry is prioritizing mental health, from providing resources and&nbsp;support to challenging beauty standards.</p><ol class='modeling-ol'><li><strong>Body image issues:</strong> Models are constantly under pressure to maintain a certain body type or size, which can lead to body image issues and even eating disorders. This pressure can come from agents, clients, and even&nbsp;from within the industry itself. The fashion industry has been criticized for promoting an unrealistic standard of beauty that can be harmful to models and to society at large.</li><li><strong>Substance abuse:</strong> The modeling industry is known for its party culture, and many models may feel pressure to keep up with their peers. This can lead to substance abuse issues, including alcoholism and drug addiction. Models may also use drugs to suppress their appetite or to cope with the pressures of the industry.</li><li><strong>Exploitation:</strong> Unfortunately, the modeling industry has a long history of exploitation, particularly of young and inexperienced models. Models may be pressured to work long hours for little pay, or to perform tasks that are outside of their job description. This can lead to feelings of powerlessness and resentment, and can even contribute to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.</li><div class='grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-0'><img src='/images/modeling-2.jpg' class='' /><img src='/images/modeling-3.jpg' class='' /><img src='/images/modeling-4.jpg'/></div><figcaption class='text-center pb-[1rem]'>Models have always voiced the lack of support in their industry but have had no real solutions offered. Photos by <a href='https://www.pexels.com/@megan-ruth-192440753/'>Megan Ruth</a> (PEXELS)</figcaption><li><strong>Lack of support:</strong> Many models work as freelancers, which can make it difficult to access support and resources when needed. They may not have access to health insurance, counseling&nbsp;services, or other resources that could help them manage their mental health. Additionally, models may be reluctant to speak out about mental health issues for fear of being seen as weak or unstable.</li><li><strong>Eating disorders:</strong> Models are often under pressure to maintain a certain weight or body shape, which can lead to the development of eating disorders. The constant scrutiny and criticism of their bodies can take a toll on their mental health and lead to dangerous behaviours like restrictive eating and over-exercising.</li><li><strong>Financial instability:</strong> While some models earn high salaries, many struggle to make ends meet and experience financial instability. This can add to the stress and anxiety of the industry, particularly when coupled with the pressure to maintain a certain appearance.</li><li><strong>Lack of privacy:</strong> Models often have to deal with a lack of privacy, with their personal lives and social media accounts constantly under scrutiny. This can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and a lack of control over their own lives.</li><li><strong>Constant rejection:</strong>&nbsp;Models face&nbsp;a high level of rejection in the industry, with many auditions and castings resulting in disappointment. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and depression.</li><li><strong>Limited career lifespan:</strong>&nbsp;The modeling industry is notorious for its limited&nbsp;career lifespan, with many models struggling to find work after their mid-20s. This can lead to a sense of uncertainty about the future and difficulty transitioning into new careers.</li></ol><h3 class='sub-head'>How does Vmodel help tackle these issues?</h3><h4 class='h4-head'>What is Vmodel?</h4><p>VModel is a platform that allows creatives to showcase their work and for businesses to hire them.

The Nigerian singer-songwriter wore a long, flowing gown that was deemed by some to be obstructive and rude to other guests.</p><p>Tems' dress at the Oscars was a stunning long flowing gown with intricate embroidery and a large train that made quite a statement on the red carpet. The intricate embroidery on the dress was a combination of floral and geometric patterns, which added texture and depth to the gown. The long train of the dress was also embroidered with the same patterns, giving it a cohesive look that flowed seamlessly from the bodice to the hemline. It featured a deep V-neckline with a sheer overlay, which added a touch of elegance to the overall look.</p><div><img src='/images/temsControversial-1.jpg' class='block m-auto' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Tems had longed for the opportunity to attend the Oscars and was eager to make a lasting impression.

Some have argued that it is the responsibility of the event organizers to ensure that there is enough space for everyone, while others believe that celebrities should be mindful of their surroundings and avoid wearing obstructive clothing.</p><p>Despite the controversy, Tems has remained unapologetic about her choice of dress. In a statement released on social media, she defended her decision to wear the gown and expressed her disappointment at the negative reactions it had received. She even took the opportunity to highlight the designer of the dress, saying that she was proud to wear a creation by a Nigerian fashion designer on such a prestigious stage.

When a user asks Word to create a document based on their data, Copilot sends the prompt to the Microsoft Graph to retrieve the necessary context and data. The prompt is then modified and sent to the GPT-4 large language model for processing. The response is then sent back to the Microsoft Graph for additional grounding, security, and compliance checks before being sent back to Microsoft 365 apps as a response or command.</p><div><img src='/images/microsoft-3.gif' class='block m-auto md:px-5 md:pt-5' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Copilot in word.

    content: "<p class='first'>The recent layoffs at Microsoft of the entire Ethics and Society team responsible for AI moderation have raised eyebrows and concerns in the tech community. The move comes as Microsoft doubles down on its investment in OpenAI, a research company co-founded by Elon Musk and focused on developing advanced AI technologies.</p><div><img src='/images/controversyAsMicrosoft.webp' class='block m-auto md:px-5 md:pt-5' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image: Getty Images</p></div><p>The Ethics and Society team was responsible for ensuring that Microsoft's AI products and services were being developed and used ethically, with a focus on issues such as privacy, bias, and fairness. The team was also responsible for critically assessing the potential risks and societal impacts of AI tools like ChatGPT, which is powered by OpenAI.</p><p>The layoffs have sparked criticism from experts in the field, who argue that it is short-sighted to dismiss the importance of ethical considerations in the development of AI. As AI technology becomes more powerful and pervasive, the potential for unintended consequences and harm increases. Without a dedicated team focused on these issues, it's possible that Microsoft's AI products and services could have negative impacts on society.</p><p>In a statement to TechCrunch, a Microsoft spokesperson downplayed the significance of the layoffs, stating that the company is 'committed to responsible AI development' and that it has 'an AI ethics board with representatives from across the company.' However, the spokesperson did not address the fact that the Ethics and Society team had been responsible for carrying out the critical work of assessing the ethical implications of AI tools.</p><p>The layoffs also come at a time when concerns are mounting about the potential misuse of AI technologies, particularly in the areas of surveillance and decision-making. The use of AI in law enforcement, for example, has been shown to perpetuate racial bias and discrimination. Without a dedicated team focused on these issues, it's possible that Microsoft's AI products and services could contribute to these problems</p><p>While the move to invest more heavily in OpenAI is certainly understandable given the company's impressive track record and potential, it's important to remember that AI is not just a technical problem to be solved. As the technology becomes more advanced and pervasive, it will have profound impacts on society, and it's crucial that ethical considerations are taken into account throughout the development process. The layoffs at Microsoft of the Ethics and Society team raise concerns about whether the company is fully committed to this task.</p>",

    contentHeader: `Celebrity Skin Care Lines: The Hype, The Critics, and The Must-Try Products`,
    content: "<p class='first'>Have you noticed the explosion of celebrity skin care lines lately? It seems like every time we turn around, another celeb is launching their own line of skin care products. From Rihanna's Fenty Skin to Kylie Jenner's Kylie Skin, everyone is jumping on the skin care bandwagon. So, what's the deal with all these lines, and are they worth the hype?</p><p>First off, we have to admit that these celebrity skin care lines are seriously popping off. With millions of followers on social media, celebs have a built-in customer base that's dying to try out their products. And let's be real, who wouldn't want to try out the same products that their fave celeb swears by?</p><p>Another perk of these lines is that many celebrities are seriously passionate about skin care. They've dealt with their own skin struggles and are invested in creating products that work. Plus, they have the financial means to invest in high-quality ingredients and cutting-edge research, resulting in some seriously innovative and effective products.</p><p>But, of course, there are some critics out there who argue that celebs are just cashing in on their fame and aren't qualified to create skin care products. And let's not forget about the price point - some of these products are seriously expensive, and similar products may already exist on the market at more affordable prices.</p><div><img src='/images/celebritySkin-1.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-cover' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5d/b3/a4/5db3a4e0757c7b8daeb9c9794b40e7dc.jpg'>pinimg.com</a></p></div><p>Plus, there have been some accusations of misleading marketing tactics. Some products may claim to be 'all-natural' or 'organic,' even if they contain synthetic ingredients. And some before-and-after photos may be heavily edited or manipulated.</p><p>Despite these concerns, celebrity skin care lines continue to be hugely popular, with new launches hitting the market all the time. In addition to Fenty Skin and Kylie Skin, other notable celeb skin care lines include KORA Organics by Miranda Kerr, Goop Beauty by Gwyneth Paltrow, and Honest Beauty by Jessica Alba.</p><p>At the end of the day, it's up to you to decide whether these lines are worth your hard-earned cash. But with so many options to choose from, it's never been easier to find the perfect products to help you achieve your skin care goals. So, which celeb skin care line will you try next? Let us know in the comments!</p><div><img src='/images/celebritySkin-2.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-cover' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/gwyneth-paltrow-knows-what-shes-doing-when-it-comes-to-these-12-beauty-products-in-2023--706924472779039440/'>Pinterest</a></p></div>",

    contentHeader: `When fashion meets technology and sustainability, DressX comes to life.`,
    content: "<p class='first'>Although the technology realm has been moving at a much quicker pace, especially after facing the Covid-19 emergence, the fashion business continues to lag. This might well be attributable to the fact that the fashion industry has historical roots and is defined by craft and tradition, and that the leaders in the industry often overlook how to be coordinated with innovation, and all its untapped potential. The latter is true until the metaverse is mentioned. Numerous fashion companies launched projects or somehow interacted with the NFT world in order to be appealing to a growing customer target market share.</p><p>To begin with, the famous French luxury Maison Louis Vuitton launched, in August 2021, “Louis: The Game”, in celebration of its 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary. It consists of a videogame whose goal is to narrate the history of the brand for those who are unfamiliar with it and, at the same time, appeal to younger generations since it is a brand mostly popular amongst adults. The game revolves around the search for 200 hidden candles, each unlocking different postcards portraying the highlights of LV’s long history throughout the years. Thirty NFTs can be found inside the game, ten of which are designed by the world-renowned digital artist <i>Beeple</i>. </p><p>Moreover, the Italian house <i>Dolce&Gabbana</i> launched the Venice-inspired “Collezione Genesi” in collaboration with UNXD, a curated NFT marketplace for digital luxury and culture. The collection constituted a nine-piece NFT collection, which was auctioned and sold all together for 1,885.719 Ether (Ethereum cryptocurrency), the equivalent of $5.7 million (Thomas, 2021). Five of the NFTs were physically designed and then turned into digital format in collaboration with UNXD. The customers’ response was incredibly positive as the exponentially increasing prices proved. The most expensive item of the collection was “The Doge Crown”, which was sold for $1.2 million (UNXD, 2021). </p><p>It is, therefore, obvious that fashion Maisons are being involved in a deep digital transformation too. In particular, these companies aim at dematerializing clothes and making them digital. </p><p>The Revolution: <i>DressX</i></p><div><img src='/images/dressX-1.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-cover' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.lofficiel.cy/fashion/dressx-new-fashion-reality'>Lofficiel.cy </a></p></div><p>One successful company that has been delving into this world from a sustainability point of view is <i>DressX</i>. It is a female-led startup that envisages the future as a generation of merchandise that is objectively sustainable in design. <i>DressX (https://dressx.com)</i> is a digital-only, multi-brand fashion platform. The company was founded by Daria Shapovalova and Natalia Modenova and it was launched in August 2020. As of 2022, it bills itself as the world's largest marketplace for digital-only fashion, with over 100 partner designers and thousands of digital goods for sale on its website (Hall, 2021). Digital fashion collections from modern brands and designers are available at this worldwide multi-brand shop. Digital fashion is the creation of virtual clothes utilizing 3D software to create a true-to-life outfit that can be visualized and simulated to appear as if it were true clothing. The company plans to have a digital circle as a value chain – from design through e-commerce, integrating AR and VR. Their motto is <i class='font-bold'>“Don't shop less, shop digital fashion”</i>. </p><p>Its key features are the app, the website and the metaverse <i>liason</i>. To begin with, the app -designed as a social network - has an incredibly accurate try-on filter which enables users to “fake” wear all the digital designs that are then sold on their website. Subsequently, customers go to the <i>DressX</i> website and search (as any other online shopping platform) for the item they are interested in buying. </p><div><img src='/images/dressX-2.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-cover' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://dressx.com'>Dressx.com </a></p></div><p>Then, individuals purchase the digital item and upload a picture of themselves, following the “how to wear” guidelines (e.g. fitted clothes, high-quality pictures, natural light). The customer receives a personalized snapshot of themselves wearing it approximately 24 hours later. Now, users have unlimited opportunities to post and share images on their preferred media platforms.</p><div><img src='/images/dressX-3.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[350px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://dressx.com'>Dressx.com </a></p></div><p><i>Twins Qjin and Qwon Han wearing Off-White digital clothes on the left, original photo on the right.</i></p><div><img src='/images/dressX-4.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain lg:max-w-[500px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.voguebusiness.com/technology/metas-avatars-just-got-a-fashion-upgrade-with-dressx'>Voguebusiness.com</a></p></div><p>The metaverse <i>liason</i> can be found in <i>DressX’s</i> and Meta’s partnership. The Ukrainian startup founders released a brand-new line of digital-only clothes on the newly launched Meta Avatar store in July 2022. According to the terms of their collaboration, <i>DressX</i> will produce monthly digital clothing for Meta. </p><p><i>DressX's first collection for Meta’s Avatar Store.</i></p><div><img src='/images/dressX-4.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain lg:max-w-[500px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniehirschmiller/2022/07/19/digital-fashion-brand-dressx-launches-on-metas-avatar-store/?sh=5fa89b0b248c'>Fobes.com</a></p></div><p>Sustainability is one of the top priorities for the creators of this pioneering startup, as well as one of the company's core principles. The potential environmental benefits of digital clothing extend beyond the finished product to the design and sampling process, which, when done digitally, results in significant savings in resource use and textile waste.</p><p><i>DressX</i> is able to aim this high in terms of being sustainable as they use CLO 3D. The latter is part of the zero-waste design software which consists of 2D/3D hybrid activities that use the objective of zero-waste to connect the 2D pattern to the 3D output. Every option affects efficiency and expression, and the 3D software allows the designer to observe the effects of these decisions in real-time (McQuillan, 2020).</p>",

    contentHeader: `Let’s talk Virtual Influencers; How are they impacting the Influencer space?`,
    content: "<p class='first'>With the expansion of the influencer space, and the expected launch of the metaverse, we’ve seen the birth and growth of the virtual model. Influencers such as Miquela (@lilmiquela), who has a following of three million on Instagram, and was created by LA-based tech start-up Brud and is managed by a PR firm Huxley are bringing out different forms of influencing. The virtual model is self-sufficient. Brands and marketing agencies will likely flock to create their own virtual influencers or avatars, whether on Instagram or the metaverse. This is likely due to the low-cost, high-reward results that these influencers provide. Once they’ve established a fan-base, they can sell-out products, inform and  excite, just like any real-life influencer. </p><div><img src='/images/virtualInfluencers-1.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[400px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/CptHD6zuSmc/'>@lilmiquela</a></p></div><p>The metaverse plays a huge role in the advent of the virtual influencer. Although not launched yet, the metaverse has been providing sneak-peaks of what the future may hold. Recently the metaverse hosted their own Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW), featuring virtual models walking their runaways. These models showcased virtual items you can buy to use on your own avatars.</p><p>As we see brands invest and develop their digital products, we’re very likely to witness the rise of the virtual influencers and they could become more mainstream. Brands will be able to establish their digital presence and build their reputation online. </p><div><img src='/images/virtualInfluencers-2.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[400px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/CptHD6zuSmc/'>@lilmiquela</a></p></div><p>Lilmiquela was recently named in TIME magazine as one of the ’25 most influential people on the internet’. She has real-life impact, interviewing celebrities such as J Balvin and modelling for established brands such as Prada. Influencers such as lilmiquela will become even more regular as we expand our humankind into a virtual reality. </p><p>Virtual influencers handled by PR agencies and brands might become harder to spot, thus, there are some concerns in terms of the safety, and transparency of these influencers. Moreso, what is the future of real-life influencers, and will this impact their presence online? </p><p>Brands such as Prada have already created their branded virtual influencers and have used virtual models for their runaways. Brands might also use these online personas to establish their political views and opinions, without harming their brands.  Real-life influencers are inevitable, they provide sound advice and are relatable and it is  hard to see a future where people don’t gravitate towards real-life people online. However, with the cost-efficiency likely to be higher with virtual influencers, I really wonder what the future holds.</p><div><img src='/images/virtualInfluencers-3.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.papermag.com/ugg-40-years-lil-miquela-campaign-2613054923.html#rebelltitem1'>Papermag.com </a></p></div>",

She was part of a unit called the West Area Computing Unit that calculated the complex trajectories for the first manned American flights into orbit and on to the moon.</p><p>This becomes even more inspirational when it is considered that she was an African-American woman during the dark days of segregation.</p><p>Until very recently this mathematical genius only gained a fraction of the recognition her and her female colleagues deserved. But the critically acclaimed film ‘Hidden Figures’, based on a non-fiction book by Margot Lee Shatterly offered a biographical account of not only Katherine Johnson, but two other African-American women who worked alongside her: Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson.</p><p>It has been really good to see how Katherine Johnson’s own trajectory of fame and recognition has rocketed in recent years!</p><h2>Ada Lovelace (1815-1852) – Computer Science</h2><div><img src='/images/womenInHistory-3.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[350px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ada-Lovelace'>Brittanica.com</a></p></div><p>Now we move on to another female savant of Maths, who in the first part of the nineteenth century has been acclaimed as the first computer programmer.</p><p>Ada Lovelace was the only legitimate child of Lord Byron.

She was also a virtuoso on the piano, and her performances were reportedly even more accomplished than those of her brother.</p><p>Despite societal restrictions on women, Fanny became a trailblazer in having some of her works officially published, prying open the door for later female composers to gain recognition</p><h2>Hedy Lamarr (1914–2000) – Inventor</h2><div><img src='/images/womenInHistory-6.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[350px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hedy-Lamarr'>Britannica.com</a></p></div><p>Every time you take for granted your new Bluetooth headphones or rely on your  Wi-Fi for work or pleasure, then try to spare a thought for Hedy Lamarr.</p><p>This Austrian-American actress as often referred to in the press as ‘the most beautiful woman in the world’.

    content: "<p class='first'>As we are celebrating all things canine at Crufts in this March edition of Vell Magazine, we would also like to offer some answers to some of the most common questions that people have asked when trying to understand their dog’s behaviour.</p><h2>Why do dogs dig?</h2><div><img src='/images/canineConundrums-1.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[350px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.breakthroughdog.co.uk/articles/health-and-wellbeing/why-do-dogs-dig/'>breakthroughdog.co.uk</a></p></div><p>We cannot blame dogs for digging as it is a deeply ingrained meta-behaviour gained from their wolfish ancestry and, as with any other instinctive behaviours, there is always a very good reason.</p><p>The ground is a natural refrigerator.  Wolves buried food that they couldn’t eat immediately in order to protect themselves and the pack against any future periods of scarcity.  This food is consequently protected from scavengers, either birds or land-based, and the wolf was able to remember the location of the cached food through associative memory and scent. </p><p>Some dogs, particularly if there are more than one dog in the household, will therefore bury ‘food’ such as bones and treats to keep them cool and protected from rival 'predators' in the household.</p><p>Also remember that Terriers or ‘earth dogs’ in Latin, such as the Rat Terrier,  were developed by the Romans to intensify this instinct in order to search for quarry or prey. </p><p> This is also the case with some scent-hounds, such as the Dachshund ‘Badger-Hounds’ in German, whose short powerful legs and long body was adapted perfectly for uncovering and navigating tunnels in search of Badgers.  Any rodents or other small animals burrowing in your yard may well be another trigger for your dog’s digging addiction.</p><p>On very hot days we sometimes consider, in moments of heated despair, sticking our head in the refrigerator door to escape the heat.  Dogs feel the same way, and this is another reason that dogs dig: to surround themselves in the colder earth in order to stay cool in the dog days of summer.</p><p>But there are few things that we can do to prevent or at least mitigate digging in our gardens.  One way is to ensure there is shade for our dogs in hot weather, as well as keeping them cool through regular grooming.</p><h3>Preventing your dog from digging</h3><p>But there are few things that we can do to prevent or at least mitigate digging in our gardens.  One way is to ensure there is shade for our dogs in hot weather, as well as keeping them cool through regular grooming.</p><p>One general method to prevent digging is diversion.  A dog who is bored and mentally and physically under-stimulated will also dig.  The provision of Kongs, puzzle-treats or even a box full of newspapers with goodies such as treats and bones hidden inside all offer excellent diversion.  If there is room, a doggy sandpit offers a way for your dog to scratch this particular itch while protecting your prize roses.</p><p>The other general approach is controlling the environment.  Placing rocks or wiring around areas that you want to protect will usually be effective.  Or even planning your garden to ensure a covering of tough shrubs or hedges in areas which you want to protect.</p><p>Some owners also lace the ground with scents that your dog will find unpleasant or uncomfortable such as coffee, ground or diced peppers or citrus fruit.</p><p>Also be sure to check your yard and the surrounding area for any infestations of rodents or other burrowing wildlife.</p><h2>Why Do Dogs Howl?</h2><div><img src='/images/canineConundrums-2.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain lg:max-w-[500px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.thewildest.com/dog-behavior/why-do-dogs-howl'>Thewildest.com</a></p></div><p>In general dogs howl, like other canids such as wolves and coyotes, as a form of long-distance communication as well as a primal GPS system.</p><p>In the wild wolves and coyotes use this for coordination, but domestic dogs have held on to this as a meta-behaviour in the domesticated world as a way of saying ‘here I am’.  Sadly, for example, dogs suffering from separation anxiety may howl as a long-distance attempt to call their human ‘pack’ in the hope that they will hear and soon return.</p><p>Sometimes this howl can also act as a warning to other roving canids in the wild.  Dogs also use the howl in this way if they see a dog through the window.  This is a ‘hey, get away from my yard’ call used just in case a they are out of range of stern bark</p><p>Wolves would need to coordinate like this during a hunt.  Some breeds of dogs, notably scent-hounds such as a Dachshund, Bloodhounds and Basset Hounds still utilise the howl as hunting dogs as a ‘here I am call’ to their 'pack' of human hunting companions and fellow dogs to alert them to the location of the quarry.</p><p>Also, if a dog is injured or anxious in any way then a howl is a way to draw attention to themselves.  Dogs will therefore still ‘howl in pain’ if they have suffered injury and are in extreme pain.</p><h2>How do I introduce my new dog or puppy to my cats?</h2><div><img src='/images/canineConundrums-3.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain lg:max-w-[450px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://businessmondays.co.uk/viovet-doubles-veterinary-support-as-covid-19-restrictions-ease/'>businessmondays.co.uk</a></p></div><p>If you really want to stop the fur from flying when you introduce your cute and cuddly bundle of canine joy to your cat, then there are steps you can take to make sure they become the best of furry friends.</p><p>First of all let them follow their noses.  Take the opportunity, if possible, to introduce something that smells of the new puppy like a blanket before the little canine comes home.  This will help offer a non-threatening first impression.</p><p>It is also a good idea that on first meeting the puppy is at its least excitable as possible.  A puppy tired out with a bit of exercise or play will lead to a more relaxed introduction.</p><p>For an untrained puppy, chasing is one of the delights in life.  The puppy should be confined in an area for the first few days, and on a lead when moving around the house.  While on the lead use positive reinforcement (treats and praise) for calmness when the cats are treated with respect rather than a sudden lunge towards them.</p><p>If they do a clear verbal ‘no’ and withhold attention to let the puppy know that his feline friends are a part of his new ‘pack’ and should be respected.</p><p>Always make sure your cats have an escape route.  A cornered cat will not only be highly stressed but could lash out and injure the puppy, setting back the socialisation ‘getting to know you’ process.</p><p>A cat tree or conveniently placed cat shelves will do the trick allowing the cats to look down (possibly both literally and metaphorically) from a safe vantage point on their new canine companion.</p><p>Always take the gradual approach and go back a few steps if either party appears stressed or anxious.</p>",

    content: "<p class='first'>There is a clear circle of creativity as the ancient past still sheds a light of understanding for young creatives in the present </p><p>At a time of a cost-of-living crisis, and sadly increasing economic poverty in Britain, many young people are rediscovering the very riches of Britain’s folklore, myth and ancient traditions and rites.</p><p>But this cannot be characterised as empty nostalgia, or even escapism, but a gaze into the past in as a way of looking forward to the future.</p><p>A sign of how these traditions are swimming determinedly into the cultural mainstream is the Guardian’s report on how popular ‘Making Mischief’, a celebration of all things folk, has become.</p><p>This is a recognition of how these old traditions are not just being rediscovered, but updated and blended into modern culture as they become a lens to understand and express individual experience</p><p>This is reflected in the ‘Making Mischief’ festival where LBQT+ performers and gay ‘bogies’ (sprites with a mischievous sense of humour) freely roam in a modern tapestry of mythmaking woven from the old tried and tested threads of narratives from ancient traditions.</p><p>The circle was an important symbol in paganism, hence the various stone circles dotted around the country, but the popularity of ‘Making Mischief’ is eloquent testament to the circle of creativity as artists revisit the past, to find the starting point for their own expression.</p><p>Looking at the rich vein of folklore and legend testifies to how below the dizzying surface of our intensely busy daily routines, there lies entwined with our beautiful landscape stories and rituals that have withstood the ravages of time, and quietly survived into what many view a spiritually impoverished modernity.</p><p>But why should the young in 2023 want to shake the earth of obscurity from these ancient cultural roots and rediscover this very rich cultural inheritance?</p><h2>Absolute legends – myths recount triumph of creative individualism</h2><div><img src='/images/ancient-1.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[450px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm pt-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.pinterest.it/pin/329607266456149348'>Pinterest.it</a></p><p class='text-center text-sm  max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Women, the aged and the peasant class who are marginalised in traditional social structures are often empowered in folk tales by their intelligence and creativity </p></div><p>For one thing these ancient stories have grown from the natural creativity of ordinary people looking not to the Church or orthodox education for answers, but simply from their own relationships with the landscape around them.  These tales and rituals therefore naturally invoke the creative sensibility of individualism untrammelled by authority or conformity.</p><p>They are often the celebration of the wit and spontaneity of the ‘peasant’ class, hence the word ‘folk’, a word that has been in use now over a millennium from the Germanic word for people, ‘volk’.  Even more striking is how that very often they celebrate the wisdom and insight of women in a patriarchal cultural system, which later denigrated and othered female wisdom through aligning female power with witchcraft.</p><p>Indeed, one such tale is regaled in Jeremy Harte’s fascinating survey of how stories blend with landscape in ‘Cloven Hoof – In search of England’s devil’.  The story of how an old woman thwarts the devil’s plan to flood her local area by building a ditch to the sea.  Unlike a very modern project such as HS2 that extends months beyond the original deadline, the tricksy devil can do this overnight.  Aware of this, the enterprising lady sneaks up on the labouring fiend with a sieve and a candle, making him believe that dawn is breaking.  He flees leaving his dastardly project incomplete, but handily leaving behind ‘The Devil’s Dyke’, a beautiful valley in Sussex.</p><p>So, rather than the church or official authority fending off the devil, the rescue of the community and the hope for the future comes from the innovation of creatives on the margins of society (indeed the overturning of authority as a main thread is fully implied by the title of the ‘Making Mischief’ Festival).</p><p>Seen in this way, alongside the desire to reconnect with nature and history, the folklore and ancient rites become a reservoir of inspiration for young creatives and those wanting to find a powerful voice for the expression of their identity.</p><p>There is also a glorious spontaneity and honesty about many of the festivals.  Take, for example, </p><p>Unsurprisingly, therefore, this folkish cultural renaissance has resounded in a various areas of creativity beyond the ancient art of storytelling.</p><h2>Myths and Modern Creativity</h2><p>If folklore celebrations are Here is a brief round-up of how modern creatives are embracing this new wave of ancient tradition.</p><h3>Fashion and Design</h3><div><img src='/images/ancient-2.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[450px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm pt-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.pinterest.it/pin/709950328755500816/'>Pinterest.it</a></p><p class='text-center text-sm  max-w-[600px] m-auto'>In 2020 Taylor Swift released her album Folklore, a real musical gem crafted in the depths of the pandemic and lockdown</p></div><p>Indeed, in the finest traditions of folklore, the album was feted for its intimate storytelling as much as its magical prowess.</p><p>But many were also inspired by the ‘Folklore Fashion’ inspired by the songstress as she sported warm cardigans (cardigan also providing a title from her album), flouncy white dresses, combat boots and checked shirts.</p><p>Although Taylor Swift exuded a traditional folk singer vibe, the last decade has seen fashion more viscerally inspired directly inspired by images and characters from these folktales.  </p><p>In 2014 Gareth Pugh launched a New York  fashion show inspired by folk that was also part dance spectacular (the show was choreographed by Wayne McGregor, of the Royal Ballet in London ).  This visual feast was also immersed  in screens and LED displays, all used to bring figures from folklore and pagan myth to stunning life in elaborate costumes.</p><p>Much of the inspiration for this show came from a Simon Costin catwalk show, a main figure in the organising of the ‘Making Mischief’ festival.</p><p>Last year Simone Rocha offered a collection based around an Irish folktale called <i>The Children of Lir</i> (which also provided the basis of Tchaikovsky’s famous ballet ‘Swan Lake’), telling the melancholic tale of a girl and her brothers transformed into swans for a period of 900 years.</p><p>The Simone Rocha collection was artfully set in a walkway around a pool of light to represent the lake of the story.</p><h3>Music</h3><div><img src='/images/ancient-3.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[450px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm pt-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://thegoodlifesociety.co.uk/camp-good-life-autumn-lineup/gwenno'>TheGoodLifeSociety.com </a></p></div><p>If you enjoyed Taylor Swifts take on folklore, then why not try a Mercury Prize winning musician and singer named Gwenno.</p><p>Gwenno’s heritage includes a Welsh Mother and a Cornish father who immersed her in the poetry and music of both Celtic traditions who has released three  critically acclaimed solo albums: <i>Y Dydd Olaf</i>, in 2014,  <i>Le Kov</i> in 2018 and  <i>Tresor</i> in 2022.

From pioneering designers to prominent editors, these women have made an undeniable imprint on the world of fashion, influencing generations of creators and clients.

Should we sit (very obediently of course) on the fence?</p><p>The answer is, as part of the dog-loving community, we find it a mixed bowl.  There are certainly some bits that we consider treats, but other parts that for us are about as appealing as old, soggy kibble.</p><p>Some will remember the controversy surrounding the German Shepherd breed standards where dogs with crooked backs, unable to stand comfortably, were entered into the show to wide public condemnation, with many animal charities voicing their concerns.</p><p>To be fair to the Kennel Club, they have addressed these concerns by tightening breed standards to avoid cruelty through breeding and pronounced ” health and welfare of dogs is the primary objective of the Kennel Club”.</p><p>Moreover, the Kennel Club do a lot of work to promote breed awareness, which is so important in ensuring people don’t adopt or buy a breed that they do not understand, sadly often leading to the surrendering of dogs.<sup><a href='https://vellmagazine.com/article/10/6'>related article</a></sup></p><p>For us, we don’t really care how well a dog meets arbitrary breed standards.  It doesn’t matter if a tail is slightly too long or short, as long as it wags.  Nor whether the head is quite the right shape; as long as it is set with big, brown adorable eyes.</p><p>Now we have dug out those bones of contention, it’s time for us get our fur wet and dive straight in to our curated highlights of the show.</p><h2>Winner or ‘Best in Show’</h2><div><img src='/images/cruft-2.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[750px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm pt-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/03/12/crufts-2023-lagotto-romangnolo-anmed-orca-wins-best-show/)'>Telegraph.co.uk</a></p></div><p>The winner of the show was a dog called Orca, whose owner described as a dog whose tail ‘never stopped wagging’.</p><p>Obviously a beautiful dog, but for Vell Magazine this was a highlight because Orca belongs to a relatively obscure breed that most of which all but the most knowledgeable dog aficionado would never have heard.</p><p>She is the first Lagotto Romagnolo ever to win Crufts.  The word ‘Lagotto’ means ‘curly-haired duck retriever’, and these dogs originally from the Italian district of Romagnolo can be described as athletic and intelligent dogs with a wonderful temperament.</p><p>Not only this, if you don’t have a pig handy, they are the only breed recognised for specialising in finding truffles in the wild, as well as having a hypoallergenic coat, meaning if fur gives you the sniffles, this rare dog breed could be for you.</p><h2>Second Place or ‘Reserve Best Show’</h2><div><img src='/images/cruft-3.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[400px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm pt-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://inews.co.uk/news/crufts-2023-who-won-what-breed-dog-winners-best-in-show-2204800'>Inews.co.uk </a></p></div><p>Continuing the Italian theme, we now turn to the dog who was just pipped to the lamppost.</p><p>I am going to declare an interest here, as I am a proud owner of one of this breed: yes, an Old English Sheepdog leapt into second (or perhaps ambled casually into second going by my experience of the breed).</p><p>What has this got to do with Italy?  Well, Blondie is actually an Italian Old English Sheepdog, if that makes sense.  </p><p>But believe it or not, most Old English Sheepdogs don’t actually come from England or the United Kingdom, in fact they have only just come off the vulnerable list of breeds in their country of origin, despite being the poster dogs for the high-profile paint brand, Dulux.</p><p>So, here’s hoping that this fluffy Sheepdog can round up more popularity in the wake of Blondie’s success.</p><p>And talking of vulnerable breeds…</p><h2>Vulnerable Breed Competition</h2><div><img src='/images/cruft-4.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[600px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm pt-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/02/11/275576004/wire-fox-terrier-wins-best-in-show-at-westminster'>Npr.com</a></p></div><p>Another amazing fact about dogs is that they are the most varied land species on earth.  The process of specialised breed towards particular jobs or functions has led to around (there were so many that have been very nearly lost, the wonderful Cane Corso from Italy and the English Mastiff just being two examples).</p><p>All these breeds have a fascinating and long history where good breeders have looked to equip our wonderful canine companions with temperaments that make them such fantastic pets.</p><p>So, one of our highlights is the vulnerable breed competition on Day 2 of Crufts.   This year included a bevy of beautiful breeds that are currently just not getting the love they deserve including: the Otterhound, the English Mastiff, the English Toy Terrier and the Kerry Blue Terrier.</p><p>And the winner was………an adorable Cardigan Welsh Corgi called Libby. Hailing from the Cardigan area of Wales and known affectionately as Cardis, these short-legged dogs are athletic and intelligent herding dogs but they are not jumpers (apologies for the terrible pun).</p><h2>East Anglian Staffordshire Bull Terrier Display Team</h2><div><img src='/images/cruft-5.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[600px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm pt-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://dogsbarn.com/how-to-stop-staffordshire-bull-terrier-pulling-on-a-lead/'>Dogsbarn.com </a></p></div><p>Even if you don’t own one, I defy anybody who has met a Staffie not to fall in love with this robust little breed.  Although they have a big fan base (they rank as the 7th most popular dog in the UK), sadly they still fall victim to unfair stereotyping. </p><p>But their days of dog fighting are mercifully long forgotten, and this marvellous breed really showed that they can really turn their paws to anything with an incredible display of obedience and agility by this acrobatic display team.</p><p>So to watch the super speedy Staffies leap, weave, bow and run through an impressive repertoire of obedience drills click on the link above.</p><p>Did you know that the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was once known as the Nanny dog due to their role in protecting small children in the household?</p><p>That close relationship with children is also celebrated in this display as</p><h2>Heelwork to Music (HTM)</h2><div><img src='/images/cruft-6.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[600px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm pt-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.lancasterguardian.co.uk/news/national/sheepdog-and-owner-from-lancaster-are-crowned-winners-at-crufts-4062109'>LancasterGuardian.co.uk </a></p></div><p>If you have never seen a Spaniel spin or a Terrier twirl to music, you should certainly check out the replay of the heelwork to music.</p><p>For me this is person and dog in perfect harmony as it showcases incredible levels of communication between the handler and their beloved canine.</p><p>These dogs just want to dance the night away, or at least, they offer truly spectacular 4-minute routines in faultless time to the music.</p><p>So, if you’re dog tired of the breed judging competitions, give these cavorting canines a whirl.</p><h2>West Midlands Dog Display</h2><div><img src='/images/cruft-7.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[600px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm pt-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.expressandstar.com/news/local-hubs/birmingham/2023/03/12/police-dogs-show-off-their-skills-as-part-of-crufts/)'>Expressandstar.com </a></p></div><p>These dogs don’t just have one lead but help their handlers follow up any number of leads in the detection of crime! And no, they don’t just chase cat burglars.</p><p>For millennia now our dogs have been keeping our homes safe and guarding us while we slept, but the modern police dog (PD) is a true professional expertly trained to only release their aggression and prey drive when precisely targeted by their handlers.</p><p>So if you want to witness the thrilling sight of canine constables leaping from Police cars to take down bad guys, I recommend catching up on this arresting display of dogged crime busting!</p><h2>Don’t forget the mixed breeds…</h2><p>What’s the most popular dog breed in the world?</p><p>Well, the real top dog is the beautiful mixed breed (sometimes known as a Mutts).</p><p>Not only this, but we also have ‘Scrufts’ to look forward to in August (which Vell Magazine shall be covering), which is the KC’s celebration of all those beautiful dogs that don’t quite fit into any of the categories of Crufts.</p>",

    content: "<p class='first'>Hey, fashion-forward babes!</p><p>If you haven't jumped on the athleisure trend yet, it's time to get on board. Athleisure, which blends sportswear with streetwear, has taken the fashion world by storm, and it's not hard to see why.</p><p>The athleisure trend has its roots in the early 2000s, when yoga pants and leggings started to become more mainstream. As more and more women started wearing athleisure pieces to the gym, they began to realise how comfortable and stylish these pieces could be.</p><div><img src='/images/gymToGlam-1.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[250px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[700px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/990229036792366557/'>pinterest.co</a></p></div><p>Fast forward to today, and athleisure is a full-blown fashion trend. From trendy sports bras to sleek leggings to statement sneakers, there's an athleisure look for everyone. And it's not just women who are embracing this trend - men are getting in on the action too, with trendy joggers and sweatpants becoming a staple in many wardrobes.</p><p>One of the reasons why athleisure has become so popular is its versatility. You can dress it up or down, depending on the occasion. Pair your favourite leggings with a cute crop top and some statement jewellery for a night out with the girls, or throw on a comfy hoodie and sneakers for a weekend brunch.</p><p>But athleisure isn't just about comfort and versatility - it's also seriously fashionable. Celebs like Beyoncé, Gigi Hadid, and Kendall Jenner have all been spotted rocking athleisure looks, and it's not hard to see why. From bold colours to trendy prints to unique silhouettes, there's no shortage of stylish athleisure pieces on the market.</p><div><img src='/images/gymToGlam-2.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[250px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[700px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/711428072409991776/'>pinterest.co</a></p></div><p>Of course, there are some critics out there who argue that athleisure isn't 'real' fashion. But we say, who cares? At the end of the day, fashion is all about expressing yourself and feeling confident in what you wear. And if that means rocking a pair of leggings and a hoodie, then so be it.</p><p>So, whether you're hitting the gym or just running some errands, athleisure fashion is the perfect choice. With its comfort, versatility, and trendiness, it's no wonder why athleisure is here to stay. So go ahead, babes - embrace the athleisure trend and show off your style!</p><div><img src='/images/gymToGlam-3.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[250px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[700px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/369576713185814519/'>pinterest.co</a></p></div>",

    contentHeader: `How Soulja Boy Used Growth Hacking to Turn "Crank That" into a Triple-Platinum Hit`,
    content: "<p class='first'>Soulja Boy, the American rapper, and producer was only 15 years old when he broke into the music industry with his song 'Crank That.' In 2007, the song quickly rose to the top of the charts, earning triple-platinum status, and even gained the attention of Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs.</p><p>But how did Soulja Boy achieve this level of success without the backing of a record label? The answer is growth hacking.</p><div><img src='/images/souljaBoy-1.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:py-5 object-contain max-w-[750px]'/></div><p>At the time, Soulja Boy had no marketing team or distributor to promote his music. He decided to take matters into his own hands and began studying the Billboard charts to see what songs were popular. He then renamed the audio file of his track to match the trending songs.</p><p>Using Limewire, an illegal file-sharing tool, Soulja Boy uploaded his song 'Crank That' under the false names of other popular songs. This meant that when people searched for a particular song, they would instead download 'Crank That.'</p><p>Soulja Boy's belief was that if people listened to his song, they would fall in love with it, and that's precisely what happened. Within a couple of weeks, 'Crank That' had reached thousands of people and began playing on the radio due to its popularity.</p><p><blockquote class='twitter-tweet p-2 relative max-w-[700px] m-auto'><p lang='en' dir='ltr'>1st rapper with the iPhone 📱 <a href='https://t.co/RwZqGB29xO'></a></p>&mdash; Soulja Boy (Big Draco) (@souljaboy)<span> July 4, 2021</span> <a href='https://twitter.com/souljaboy/status/1411487498778210308?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw' class='absolute bottom-[-20px] sm:bottom-[-10px] right-2'>See on twiter</a></blockquote> <script async src='https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js' charset='utf-8'></script></p><p>As the song gained traction, record labels started approaching Soulja Boy, desperate to sign what had become the hottest artist of the moment. 'Crank That' even broke records on iTunes as one of the most downloaded songs of the era.</p><p>Big Draco stated in a ‘Million Dollaz Worth of Game podast’:</p><p><i>“I was the first rapper with the iPhone,” Soulja Boy calmly states as the hosts of the podcasts erupt into laughter in disbelief. “It was ‘Crank Dat’ video shoot 2007. Steve Jobs and the Apple team came. I was in the swimming pool, doing the instructional dance. Showing the people how to do the dance. We was on the set of the ‘Crank Dat’ video. They came, they brought me the iPhone.”</i></p><div><img src='/images/souljaBoy-3.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:py-5 object-contain max-w-[350px]'/><p class='text-md text-center font-semibold'><a href='https://www.instagram.com/reel/CQ4KcpDncQi/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=bf75043e-c67f-4b16-a66b-12c7cf6c354a'>View more</a></p></div><p>The buzz surrounding Soulja Boy's success even caught the attention of Apple's Steve Jobs, who invited him to the company's headquarters. Jobs personally gave Soulja Boy the very first iPhone, which the rapper held up in his viral music video, further capitalizing on the marketing opportunity.</p><p>Soulja Boy's success story is a testament to the power of growth hacking, which involves creative and unconventional methods to grow a business or brand. By thinking outside the box and using tactics like renaming audio files and leveraging peer-to-peer sharing networks, Soulja Boy was able to turn 'Crank That' into a cultural phenomenon that would go down in history.</p>",

    contentHeader: `Fashion for all sizes: Celebrating body diversity in the industry`,
    content: "<p class='first'>For too long, the fashion industry has been criticised for its narrow focus on thin, tall, and predominantly white models. However, in recent years, we've seen a shift towards celebrating body diversity in fashion. More brands are embracing inclusivity and featuring models of all shapes and sizes, and consumers are demanding more representation in the industry.</p><p>This change in the fashion industry is long overdue. According to a study by the International Journal of Fashion Design, Technology, and Education, the average American woman is a size 16, but the fashion industry's standard sizing only goes up to a size 12. This means that a large portion of the population has been excluded from mainstream fashion, leaving them feeling unseen and unrepresented.</p><p>Fortunately, there are now more options available for women of all sizes. Brands are starting to offer a wider range of sizes, and some are even using plus-size models to showcase their clothing. The rise of social media has also helped to boost the visibility of body-positive influencers who promote self-love and acceptance, challenging the industry's traditional beauty standards.</p><p>One of the pioneers of body diversity in the industry is the plus-size brand, Lane Bryant. They have been using plus-size models in their campaigns for over a decade, and their 'I'm No Angel' campaign in 2015 aimed to celebrate all body types and challenge the industry's narrow beauty standards. Other brands like Aerie, ModCloth, and Universal Standard have also made strides towards body inclusivity, using models of various sizes and shapes in their campaigns.</p><p>However, it's not just about featuring models of different sizes; it's also about designing clothes that flatter different body types. Brands like Spanx and Shapermint are creating shapewear that supports and enhances curves, while other brands like Good American and Levi's have designed jeans that fit a range of body types.</p><p>It's essential to recognize that body diversity in fashion is not just a trend but a necessary step towards a more inclusive industry. Everyone deserves to feel seen and celebrated, no matter their size or shape. By embracing body diversity, the fashion industry has the power to change how society views beauty, promoting a message of inclusivity, and empowering people to feel confident in their bodies.</p><p>In conclusion, the fashion industry has made strides in promoting body diversity in recent years. More brands are embracing inclusivity, using models of different sizes, and designing clothes that flatter a range of body types. This shift is necessary, as it promotes a message of self-love and acceptance, challenging the industry's traditional beauty standards. It's a step towards creating a more inclusive society where everyone can feel seen and celebrated, regardless of their size or shape.</p>",

    contentHeader: `5 Effective Ways to Boost Your Serotonin`,
    content: "<p class='first'>Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in regulating mood, appetite, and sleep. Low levels of serotonin have been linked to depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders. Fortunately, there are several proven ways to boost your serotonin levels and improve your mood naturally. Here are 5 effective ways to do so:</p><h3>Get some sunlight</h3><p>Exposure to sunlight is one of the most effective ways to increase serotonin levels. Sunlight triggers the brain to produce more serotonin, which can help improve your mood and reduce symptoms of depression. Spend some time outside every day, especially in the morning, to get your daily dose of natural light.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Exercise is another powerful way to boost serotonin levels. Any form of exercise, from a brisk walk to a vigorous workout, can help improve your mood and reduce symptoms of depression. Exercise releases endorphins, which are chemicals in the brain that can elevate your mood and make you feel good.</p><h3>Eat foods rich in tryptophan</h3><p>Tryptophan is an amino acid that is essential for the production of serotonin. Eating foods that are rich in tryptophan, such as turkey, chicken, fish, eggs, and cheese, can help increase serotonin levels naturally. It's also important to pair tryptophan-rich foods with carbohydrates, which can help the brain absorb tryptophan more effectively.</p><h3>Practice relaxation techniques</h3><p>Stress can have a negative impact on serotonin levels, so it's important to find ways to relax and reduce stress in your life. Techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, yoga, and massage can all help to increase serotonin levels and improve your mood.</p><h3>Get enough sleep</h3><p>Sleep plays a crucial role in the production and regulation of serotonin. Not getting enough sleep can disrupt serotonin levels and contribute to mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to ensure that your body has enough time to produce and regulate serotonin levels.</p><p>In conclusion, there are several effective ways to boost your serotonin levels and improve your mood naturally. By incorporating these tips into your daily routine, you can help support your mental health and well-being.</p>",

    contentHeader: `Kim Kardashian to Join American Horror Story`,
    content: "<p class='first'>Reality TV star and entrepreneur Kim Kardashian has been announced as a new addition to Ryan Murphy’s <em>American Horror Story</em>, season 12. For the upcoming season, Kardashian is signed up to a lead role that was written specifically for her. FX (Fox Extended), the television channel that airs <em>American Horror Story</em>, confirmed Kardashian’s casting to <em>Variety</em> but neither FX nor the star have revealed any information about her character or the season.</p><p>Coming this summer and named “Delicate”, the season will also feature Emma Roberts - an <em>American Horror Story (A.H.S.)</em> regular - while having been entirely written and showrun by Hailley Feiffer. This will be the first season written exclusively by one person.</p><p>Co-creator Ryan Murphy, also known for <em>Glee</em> (2009-2015) and <em>Dahmer</em> (2022), stated to <em>THR</em>, “Kim is among the biggest and brightest television stars in the world and we are thrilled to welcome her to the <em>AHS</em> family, Emma and I are excited about collaborating with this true force in the culture. Halley Feiffer has written a fun, stylish and ultimately terrifying role especially for Kim, and this season is ambitious and unlike anything we have ever done”.</p><p>Allegedly friends, Murphy and Kardashian have been planning her <em>A.H.S.</em> debut since summer 2022 and it is set to be filmed in New York City from this April. Although not her first acting role (though having mainly done cameos), this will be Kardashian’s biggest and most prominent to date. It will also be Roberts’ return to <em>A.H.S.</em> since taking a four year hiatus, having previously starred in the series since 2013.</p><p>Kardashian made the announcement to her 350 million Instagram followers via a <a href='https://www.instagram.com/p/Cq3I8_jLRMX/?hl=en'>cryptic teaser video</a> that only revealed her and Roberts’ castings. The background music hinted at a storyline with a cover of the nursery rhyme and lullaby ‘Rock-a-bye Baby’. Roberts posted the same video to her Instagram.</p><p>“Delicate” is the first season in the series to use source material, basing itself (or at least partly) on the upcoming novel <em>Delicate Condition</em>, by Danielle Valentine. Coming out in August, it is about a woman who believes that there is a dark force trying to prevent her pregnancy. The book's cover blurb (by author Andrea Bartz) describes it as “the feminist update to ‘<em>Rosemary’s Baby</em>’ we all needed”.</p><p><em>American Horror Story</em> first premiered in 2011 and has since received over 100 Emmy nominations. Some of the cast has included Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett and Lady Gaga. The 12th season is expected to have a summer premiere, though Murphy and FX aren’t expected to announce a specific date until June.</p>",

    contentHeader: `Does Nike Have A Women Problem?`,
    content: "<p class='first'>Nike are no strangers to courting controversy and this week is no exception.  Under a mantra of “be kind, be inclusive” Nike have this week revealed the transgender woman Dylan Mulvaney as a new ambassador of the brand.  But not all have welcomed the sportswear giant’s new face, with woman’s groups and feminists decrying the use of a biological male to sell sports bras as an insult to women.</p><p>This is not however the first time Nike have faced backlash over their treatment of women and seems to be a just one part of a pattern of behaviour which has enraged women.</p><h3>A history of Nike’s controversies with women:</h3><h3><u>Dylan Mulvaney</u></h3><p>Though it is becoming more and more common to see transgender ambassadors for brands all around the world, many women have taken exception to Mulvaney’s role as a model for sports bras.  As a transgender woman who has not yet physically transitioned, feminists argue that Nike has snubbed women.  The fact that they have chosen Mulvaney to market a product specifically for women is undoubtedly a controversial if not savvy marketing move.  Feminist groups have called for a boycott of Nike products as a result of the campaign.</p><h3><u>Allyson Felix</u></h3><div><img src='/images/allyson-felix.png' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain max-w-[450px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allyson_Felix'>Wikipedia</a></p></div><p>Allyson Felix is a former 100, 200 and 400m runner, winning seven Olympic gold medals and 14 World Championship golds over her illustrious career which she finished as the most decorated female athlete in Olympic history.  Despite being one of Nike’s most famous and successful ambassadors, their partnership turned sour when she fell pregnant, Nike slashing her contract by 70%.  As a result of her disagreement with the brand, Felix broke all dealings with Nike and penned an essay in the New York Times along with two other athletes, Alysia Montaño and Kara Goucher, calling for fairer treatment of pregnant athletes.</p><h3><u>Tiger Woods Scandal</u></h3><div><img src='/images/tiger-woods.png' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain h-[210px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://aaww.org/hello-world-how-nike-sold-tiger-woods/'>Asian American Writers’ Workshop</a></p></div><p>Despite not having the back of their own female athletes, Nike loyally stood by golfer Tiger Woods in spite of revelations of multiple affairs and a sex addiction. Other high-profile sponsors such as Gatorade, General Motors and AT+T took a different approach, cutting links with Woods as a consequence of his damaged reputation.  The difference in the treatment of Woods and female athletes is in stark contrast and reveals a vastly different policy when deciding how to face the changed circumstances of their athletes.</p><h3><u>Lawsuit alleging a toxic culture of sexism at Nike</u></h3><p>Nike are currently embroiled in a 5000-page lawsuit which details sexual harassment and gender discrimination allegations from female employees against the company.  The lawsuit accuses Nike executives of, amongst other allegations, exerting power over lower-level female employees, sexual impropriety and creating a “boys’ club” culture which has established a toxic and intimidating work environment for female employees.  The litigation is ongoing. So does Nike have a women problem?  At the very least, it seems that Nike doesn’t embrace the “be kind, be inclusive” mantra which they themselves claim to support.  It will be for the courts to decide to what extent the work culture at the company needs to change but, as the consumer, we have the power to send a clear message to Nike that such discrimination won’t be tolerated.</p>",

    content: "<p class='first'>The recent divorce story of Moroccan footballer Achraf Hakimi has caused quite a stir in the media. His ex-wife Hiba Abouk, who reportedly asked for half of his fortune in the divorce settlement, discovered that there was nothing in his name to claim.</p><p>According to recent reports, high-profile divorces in the world of sports are becoming increasingly common, with some women seeking to claim a significant portion of their former partner's wealth. The cases of former Arsenal player Emmanuel Eboue and Moroccan footballer Achraf Hakimi are two such examples that have sparked intense debate.</p><p>Eboue's ex-wife Aurelie filed for divorce in 2017, claiming half of his wealth. The couple had been married for over a decade and had three children together. However, after a difficult legal battle, it was revealed that Eboue had lost all of his wealth due to a combination of financial mismanagement and a contentious divorce settlement. The former player was left homeless and struggling to rebuild his life.</p><div><img src='/images/eboue.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain lg:max-w-[450px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/entertainment/news/article/2001398809/lessons-from-the-tragic-story-of-emmanuelle-eboue'>The Standard</a></p></div><p>On the other hand, Achraf Hakimi's ex-wife Hiba Abouk recently tried to claim half of his fortune in their divorce settlement, only to discover that he had nothing in his name. This revelation caused a stir on social media, with some applauding Hakimi for being financially savvy, while others criticized him for not being honest with his partner.</p><p>The question that arises from these cases is whether a woman needs to claim half of her partner's wealth to be happy. While some argue that it is only fair for the partner who supported their spouse to claim a portion of their wealth, others believe that such claims can be excessive and unfair.</p><p>These cases are not limited to sports stars alone. Many successful men in various industries have faced similar challenges in their relationships. There is a growing concern that a lot of women get intos relationships to 	&quot;secure the bag,&quot; or to gain financial security through a partner rather than building their own wealth. Some men are known for this too, not just as common. Relationships should be based on trust, respect, and mutual support, rather than financial gain. While it is understandable for anyone to want to protect their assets, it is crucial to approach the issue of finances and divorce settlements with fairness and transparency.</p><p>In the case of Eboue, his struggles serve as a cautionary tale about the importance of sound financial planning and seeking legal advice during divorce proceedings. It is also worth noting that despite the hardships he faced, Eboue eventually moved on and found a way to rebuild his life.</p><p>For Hakimi, in a shocking turn of events, Hiba has now been ordered to give half of her net worth to Hakimi after filing for divorce.

I’d say it is crucial to approach these issues with empathy and understanding, recognizing that each situation is unique and requires a fair and transparent approach.</p>",

    contentHeader: `Dame Mary Quant: Remembering the Legacy of a Fashion Icon and Trailblazer`,
    content: "<p class='first'>Dame Mary Quant, who passed away at the age of 90, was a visionary designer whose influence can still be seen in the world of fashion today. Born in London in 1934, she studied illustration at Goldsmiths College before opening her first boutique, Bazaar, on King's Road in 1955. Her designs quickly gained a following, and by the 1960s, she was a household name.</p><p>Quant is best known for her playful, youthful designs, which helped define the Swinging Sixties. She is credited with popularising the mini skirt, which she designed in 1965, and hot pants, which made their debut in 1970. Her bold use of colour and pattern, as well as her experimentation with new materials such as PVC, were also groundbreaking at the time.</p><p>But Quant's influence extends beyond her contributions to design. She was also a trailblazer for women in business, founding her own fashion label and building it into a global empire. She was one of the first designers to understand the importance of licensing her name and designs, and her products were sold in over 100 countries around the world.</p><div><img src='/images/mary-quant-2.jpeg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain lg:max-w-[450px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://fashion-era.com/60s-mini-skirt/?amp=1'>Fashion-era</a></p></div><p>Quant's business savvy was matched by her creativity, and she was constantly pushing boundaries and experimenting with new ideas. In addition to fashion, she also designed cosmetics, accessories, and even homeware. Her playful, irreverent style was a breath of fresh air in the often-stuffy world of fashion.</p><p>But Quant's impact wasn't just limited to the fashion industry. Her designs were part of a wider cultural movement, one that celebrated youth, freedom, and experimentation. Her clothes were worn by the likes of Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton, and other style icons of the era, and they helped define the look of the time.</p><p>Quant's influence can still be seen today, both in the world of fashion and beyond. Her legacy has inspired countless designers, and her approach to business has paved the way for generations of female entrepreneurs. In 2015, she was awarded a DBE for her contributions to the fashion industry, cementing her place in British cultural history.</p><p>But despite her success and accolades, Quant remained humble and grounded throughout her life. She once said, &quot;I never thought of myself as a fashion designer. I just wanted to make clothes that people would wear.&quot; Her dedication to creating clothes that were both stylish and accessible was part of what made her such a beloved figure in the industry.</p><p>In the years since Quant first burst onto the scene, the fashion industry has changed dramatically. But her legacy remains as strong as ever, a testament to her talent, creativity, and determination. She will be missed, but her impact will be felt for generations to come.</p>",

contentHeader: `AI is Wasted on Reproducing Traditional Art`,
content: `<p class='first'>All new technology goes through a period of controversy and suspicion where it is unclear if it’s truly a breakthrough or a fad that will disappear from the public consciousness after a few years. This has been especially true however for AI art, which has become very popular on the internet while also raising serious ethical questions.</p>
<p>One of the main concerns is the fact that individuals who generate AI artworks are rarely upfront about where and who their programs are sampling art from. While this is not a problem with works that are in the public domain, it has raised alarm from current artists who are now seeing their styles being reproduced without any permission or consultation. Comic book artist Bill Sienkiewicz expressed his thoughts about the situation very clearly in this<a href='https://twitter.com/sinKEVitch/status/1620266812670894081?s=20' target='_blank'> tweet from January</a>, while a group of students and professors from the University of Chicago have invented <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/17/glaze-generative-ai-art-style-mimicry-protection/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAA87t-ZdqdrGhDDu0zgm5UtMphELI9Ve1t0qjKGjmk_n9LyHlhzPrusVU-Ur04aM0gh9WURSLAhXynUTbuTtm_kgQObD-zXi6QLDzFzXqI0J5wt8xt941Va589HiLj-MBsMxl0gXNr5w_L2i3qn4P1uv4klXi0ttWHDfuI20hi_x' target='_blank'>Glaze</a> . This free software is designed to protect artwork from AI mimicry by making subtle permutations to a finished piece.</p>
<p>These developments have angered many AI users; I believe they are wasting their energy and time by having AI reproduce traditional art though. The fact is there are many artists who are reliant on commissions for their income and this new trend could devastate their livelihoods. However, no human artist could have ever created <a href='https://www.twitch.tv/unlimitedsteam' target='_blank'> Unlimited Steam</a>. This is an ongoing Twitch stream that tasks <a href='https://gizmodo.com/twitch-ai-the-simpsons-unlimited-steam-openai-1850145942' target='_blank'>AI with replicating the famous Steamed Hams sketch</a> from <i>The Simpson’s episode 22 Short Films About Springfield</i>.</p>
<p>An episode of Unlimited Steam is about three minutes long and features low-poly versions of Principal Skinner and Superintendent Chalmers stumbling around a burning replica of Skinner’s house. While it follows the same formula as the original scene, the dialogue is always surprising in its absurdity – often Skinner will ask a higher power for assistance with his cooking.</p>
<p>The best part is that the anonymous creator of Unlimited Steam seems aware of the issues with AI art. A line in the description reads “High quality AI content? No, writers needed!” While this is a reference to Lionel Hutz’s business card, it also indicates the creator is aware that AI currently cannot (and should not) replace creatives and this is not the purpose of Unlimited Steam. Instead, Unlimited Steam is providing entertainment that is too niche and time-consuming for human creators to possibly do – after all, even one episode would require writers, animators, and voice actors who can mimic the original cast. This is one aspect of an AI future that we can all look forward to – responses to art instead of replacements for art.</p>`,

contentHeader: `D-Day is approaching - BTS’ Suga’s First Official Album Release`,
content: `<p class='first'>Music opens new doors to the public, as it provides a platform to speak on a wide array of issues ranging from social constructs to mental health. In this era of advancement, music of all different languages talks about any issue. A new album that talks about the struggles of dealing with the stress that Covid-19 and the personal anguish caused by life has left behind will be released on the 21st of April 2023 at 12 AM EST or 5 AM BST.
</p>
<p>
This is the album released by the artist, Suga, from the worldwide popular band BTS. The band is known for always speaking up on problems that society faces and has been doing so since its debut in 2013. Although the language they sing in is not English, their music is known to transcend the language barrier as they touch hearts all over the globe with their lyrics and the emotion put into performing the song.
</p>
<p>
Due to their patriotic duties, the band went on a three-year-long hiatus last year. This led to each member of the 7-seven group having solo debuts and releases all year long. With four solo releases by Jin, RM, J-hope, and Jimin down, the next to join the lineup is Suga. 
</p>
<p>
Suga will be releasing his first official album, D-Day, under the artist pseudonym of Agust D. Agust D is the persona under which Suga is most true to his intimate self and explores the depth of his mind, which he could not explore as Suga- The member of BTS.
</p>
<a href='https://twitter.com/BIGHIT_MUSIC/status/1642542471178772481' target='_blank'>
<img src='/images/bts-suga-first.jpg' alt='release date' class='block m-auto w-full h-3/6 py-2 sm:py-0' />
</a>
<p>
Although this is his first album with a physical release, Suga has released two prior albums titled, Agust D in 2016 and D-2 in 2020, as official mixtapes with only digitals on SoundCloud and later on Spotify. 
</p>
<p>
Similar to his previous albums, it is assumed that D-Day will talk about mental health and Suga’s personal struggles with it. 
</p>
<p>
In the album <i>Agust D</i> , the highlighted topic was the angry emotions and the issues he had during his teenage years and how he confronts them. The song that is the most notable about mental health in this album is <i>The Last</i>, where Suga portrays his struggle with Depression and OCD in his teens and how he was no longer the same person as he evolved into a new person when the song was released. 
</p>
<p>
D-2, on the other hand, is mentioned to be the ‘documentation of myself as a 28-year old’ as quoted by Suga himself. This album mentions the evolution that he went through from what he used to be. He explores the concepts of human nature and differences in how people exist with love in the song <i>People</i>. 
</p>
<div class='lg:flex md:flex lg:justify-evenly lg:gap-x-6 md:gap-x-6'>
<p>
Due to all the mentions of mental health, it can be assumed that D-Day will be similar in nature. The pre-release track for this album, <i> People pt.2 ft. IU </i> was released on 7th April 2023. This song is a direct extension of the song <i>People</i> from the previous album. <i>People pt.2</i> explored human nature and how fragile it is in the face of a global pandemic. Suga uses metaphors of sandcastles to mention how easily the connections built can be overturned. 
</p>
<a href='https://twitter.com/BIGHIT_MUSIC/status/1643267184766906371' target='_blank'>
<img src='/images/pre-release-agust-d.jpeg' alt='pre release' class='object-contain w-3/4 h-3/4 py-2 sm:py-0' />
</a>
</div>
<p>
The pre-release track has shown great promise and has only heightened the expectations for the album to come. As was mentioned by Suga at the end of the MV of <i>People pt.2</i>, this song and the album will be about the emotions he felt during the global lockdown of the pandemic in 2020. 
</p>

<img src='/images/suga-tour.jpeg' alt='Suga tour 'class='block m-auto w-full h-3/6 py-2 sm:py-0' />
</a>
<p>
D-Day will also be serving as Suga’s opening to the World Tour under the same name that kicks off on April 26th at UBS Arena in Belmont Park, NY, USA. The album release will also be followed by a Documentary on Disney+: <i>Road to D-Day</i>. The wait till the album is shorter than anticipated.

<p>
Are you a TikTok user baffled by the sudden number of unknown cover versions by famous
artists on your FYP? Recently a version of <i>Just the Two of Us </i> by Kanye West caught my eye,
and ear. That’s different I thought; a softer, more melodic version of West- why not? I scrolled
on, thinking no more of it. That is until I came across the Kanye West version of Lana del Rey’s
<i>Video Games </i>.
</p>
<p>
<i>Video Games </i> is, in my opinion, one of the greatest love songs ever. Yes, ever. Such is del Rey’s
talent, it’s hard to imagine a cover version that could even touch the original version, her
haunting, deep voice simply perfection.
</p>
<p>
I checked myself. Why shouldn’t Kanye West turn his own undisputed talents to something like
this? Many other cases of artists covering songs way out of their comfort zone exist; Florence
and the Machine’s version of Drake and Rihanna’s <i>Take Care </i> is a masterpiece equalling, if not
bettering, the original version.
</p>
<p>
I was intrigued enough to check the comments. Face-palm moment; this wasn’t in fact Kanye
West but an AI-generated cover version. I sighed, pondering how much of my future time
would be taken up checking the veracity of, well, everything. Isn’t even music sacred?
</p>
<p>
I delved a little more into the subject and came across another song, a collaboration between
Canadian artists Drake and The Weeknd, a classic combination; the maple syrup to the
pancake, the chip to the gravy. Only this wasn’t a crossover of Canadian greats but another
example of AI generated music.
</p>
<p>
So what on earth is going on? The song, named <i>Heart on my Sleeve</i>, created by the mysterious
Ghostwriter, uses AI technology to mimic the vocal tones of the two artists, creating a
soundalike version of a song never conceived either by artist or the music industry.
</p>
<p>
What, if any, is the impact of this new trend on the music industry? Is it just a lark or is there
something more sinister going on?
</p>
<p>
From the point of view of music labels it certainly isn’t a joke. AI-generated music, be it
imitating already established artists or creating new, artificial voices, represents an existential
threat to the future of music as we know it. AI-generated music will present a new genre of
music which side-steps music labels and will enable creators without traditional musical talent
to flood the market with their songs. It’s surely a concept which music labels and artists alike
will be keen to nip in the bud.
</p>
<p>
And what about<i>Heart on my Sleeve ?</i> The music itself is a simple combination of four piano
notes and a rap beat, the artificially constructed voices uncannily similar to Drake’s and The
Weeknd’s.
</p>
<a href='https://www.vogue.com/article/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-reportedly-breakup' target='_blank'>
<img src='/images/weekend-x-selena.png' alt='release date' class='block m-auto w-full h-3/6 py-2 sm:py-0' />
</a>
<p>
References to The Weeknd’s ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez in the lyrics was a savvy way to court
controversy, Ghostwriter clearly knowing what pop culture references to tap into to create the
most hype around his creation.
</p>
<p>
<i>Heart on my Sleeve</i> is a solid song, revolutionary not in its beat or lyrics but in its implications
for the future of the music business. Thinking on the use of AI’s potential as a creative outlet
or as a threat to established artists and labels will of course come down to individual
perspective. What is certain is that this is only the tip of the iceberg of AI’s influence, an
equally scary and exciting prospect for the future.

<p>
<i>Dungeons and Dragons: Honour Among Thieves</i> is Hasbro’s first attempt to adapt the popular table-top roleplaying game into a major motion picture. The film is certainly off to a good start, receiving positive reviews from fans and critics alike. After seeing it with a party of mine own, it’s easy to understand why. The combination of practical effects and CGI creates some excellent creatures and spell effects, and all the action scenes are dynamic and engaging to watch. However, there is one aspect that might frustrate hardcore D&D fans.
</p>
<p>
The main party is simply not very fantastical when you look at the options presented in D&D’s current core rulebooks. Consisting of two humans, a half-elf, and a tiefling, it feels very much like a party designed for an easy introduction to Dungeons and Dragons, rather than one that truly shows the creativeness of the Forgotten Realm’s setting. And this is obvious when you closely examine the tiefling party member. Warning for some mild spoilers coming up.
</p>
<p>
Doric (Sophia Lillis) is a tiefling druid who is part of the Emerald Enclave, a druid enclave that protects the wilderness of the Sword Coast. She became a druid after being cast out by her human family for being a tiefling (in D&D, tieflings are individuals who manifest devilish features and powers, but it can skip generations. If you’re unfamiliar with the lore, it’s like being a mutant from X-Men.) Doric’s distrust of humans is her main characteristic throughout the movie… which is not very imaginative. It feels like the writers were just taking inspiration from the Player’s Handbook entry on tieflings and did not consider other options to distinguish the character from the many other tieflings in D&D adaptations. 
</p>
<a href='https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qO5CNr1FT5XlyEp7XWlIozw-0BE=/0x0:2880x1622/1200x800/filters:focal(1210x581:1670x1041)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67697352/Baldur_s_Gate_3_Druid_Grove.0.png' target='_blank'>
<img src='/images/dnd-1.jpg' alt='image' class='block m-auto w-full h-3/6 py-2 sm:py-0' />
</a>
<p>
For example, Baldur’s Gate 3 from Larian Studios has a whole camp of tieflings you can interact with who have also been exiled from a mainly human community. And when you compare these characters to Doric, you notice that Doric barely looks like a tiefling at all. She does not have an unusual skin tone, her horns barely protrude from her hair, and her eyes are completely normal. When you start thinking about it, it seems like a bizarre decision to focus her character’s story on being different, and then only half-heartedly commit to making her look different. Especially when a film from 2004 has already done this this kind of character arc better. 
</p>

<img src='/images/dnd-2.jpg' alt='image' class='block m-auto w-full h-3/6 py-2 sm:py-0' />
</a>
<p>
Hellboy (2004) is still a masterclass in character and monster design. Hellboy (Ron Perlman) himself looks truly amazing and you never doubt once in the movie that his character’s anxieties about his appearance are genuine and significant. Del Toro and Perlman’s work show that an actor can portray emotional nuance while under significant make-up, and when you consider that Honour Among Thieves came out almost twenty years after Hellboy it is baffling that they did not commit to giving Doric a more fiendish look.

Owning a football is nothing new for celebrities; think Elton John at Watford, Alan Sugar or even Delia Smith at Norwich as just three examples.</p><p>What’s perhaps less well-known are the growing number of celebrities investing in football clubs both in the UK and in the States. Here are some familiar faces who double as football club owners.</p><h3><u>Lebron James: Liverpool FC</u></h3><div><img src='/images/lebron.jpg' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain lg:max-w-[450px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/lebron-james-poses-new-liverpool-26193704'>Liverpool FC</a></p></div><p>LeBron is said to own a 2% stake in the Merseyside club, reportedly investing 4.9 million pounds in 2011.

Portman and friends are the only celebs on this list to invest in women’s football, seeing a stake in the LA team not only as a wise investment but a chance to raise the profile of the sport and celebrate its athletes.</p><h3><u>Will Ferrell: LAFC</u></h3><div><img src='/images/will-ferrell.webp' class='block m-auto  md:pt-5 object-contain lg:max-w-[450px]' /><p class='text-center text-sm py-1 max-w-[600px] m-auto'>Image source:<a href='https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/lafcs-will-ferrell-shows-why-hes-coolest-owner-sports-team-podcast'>Major League Soccer</a></p></div><p>Though most would associate Will Ferrell with ice skating, not football, Ferrell is an investor and supporter of LAFC.
